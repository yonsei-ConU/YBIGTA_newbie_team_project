8,2025-07-24,"Muy buena peli, no hace falta ver las 16 anteriores para entenderla"
7,2025-07-24,"Bom filme A trama e cativante e gostosa de assistir, fui achando que era um filme chato e me surpreendi. Embora tenha boas qualidades eu sinto que os vilões se passam bastante no filme, a ponto de serem exageradamente caricatos, e faz parecer com que a critica ao capitalismo e poder que o filme tanto impõe, pareça mera bobagem perante ao todo. No duro isso não me incomodou tanto, mas fora isso é uma trama bem simples, e o começo… more"
7,2025-07-24,Nice one..felt really good watching it
6,2025-07-24,Good movie didn’t like it
8,2025-07-24,é bom mas podia ter mais plot
8,2025-07-24,no começo não tava entendendo nada depois piorou e no final eu entendi
8,2025-07-24,"This is the second clone sci-fi movie I’ve watched this year. The story line is very good, and the quirky characters just add an edge of whimsy. This one is fun."
6,2025-06-05,"watched this on the plane, need a second watch on solid ground"
8,2025-07-24,what? but in a good way
8,2025-07-24,peut être j’avais été dure la première fois mea culpa rayan
6,2025-06-15,"gostei da mensagem, ela causa bastante incômodo, mas ao mesmo tempo eu não me conectei muito. resumindo, é mais um filme que vc diz ""assistido 😃"" com um alívio de ter acabado pq parece que não tem fim sos"
8,2025-07-24,awhileeeee
7,2025-07-24,"wait, is this fucking play about us?"
6,2025-07-20,really engaging but sometimes it felt like it leaned too much into light-hearted comedy and lost some of the drama and intrigue
6,2025-07-24,Aquesta peli ha sigut una experiencia ja que la durada de la meva visualització ha estat de 12 hores aprox lol. Estava a l'avio mirant-la tan cansada que m'anava dormint i parant-la lo qual ha fet que m'enteri de mitja i la vegi d'una manera diferent. Pero ni tan mal fer de 20 en 20 mins jajajaj. Es una altre experiencia. Com sopar de tapes a diferents bars jajaja. All in all m'ha fet molta gracia el personatge del mickey… more
6,2025-07-24,just not really what i wanted it to be from my boi Bong
9,2025-07-24,Im glad that‘s where he at after The Twilight.
6,2025-07-24,Edward no!
6,2025-07-24,"Mickey 17 was good, not great. Pretty woke and numerous unnecessary plot lines that bored"
9,2025-07-24,"fuck u marshall— and fuck me, mickey"
6,2025-07-24,Legit usa lore
10,2025-07-24,saw this in imax twice and i wish i saw it a third time
4,2025-07-20,Dull
4,2025-07-24,"Set up is very promising, very intrigued by the whole a man who has died all the time. And was excited of how he would bread said cycle…. Nop lets just make the second half of the film about something else completely and give this dude the least amount of character development"
6,2025-07-24,best part of this was nasha cursing marshall out
7,2025-07-20,"Robert Pattinson, who continues to be one of the most interesting actors working today is matched up with a director who is just as interesting in this sci-fi film that plays in similar themes as his other films but with a nice fresh take."
8,2025-07-24,Finally an original story. Interesting and great pacing.
5,2025-07-24,A regarder en VO (VF à chier) Blockbuster bizarroïde mais drôle et porté par un lourd casting
2,2025-07-24,Enttäuschend.
8,2025-07-22,"Yes, this is bloated—and perhaps a bit unfocused—, but it is still one of the most ambitious and original films of the past few years. Boon Jong Ho is an excellent director, and the production design of this film truly feels lived in. Robert Pattinson is also quite fantastic in this, and I do believe he truly makes Mickey 17 and Mickey 18 feel like two distinct personalities— yet one person— at the same time. If I do have a… more"
6,2025-07-24,Not what I expected at all but what was rpatz’s accent? Like there were British people in the film?
9,2025-07-24,crazy parallels
8,2025-03-28,Was hard to get into at first but ended really well. Felt like it dragged on too much tho.
6,2025-03-14,"o filme é legal, meio arrastado em algumas partes, mas é bom"
8,2025-07-25,"Pretty original movie, really enjoyed this one, if this is what it looks like for Elon's Mars trip count me out"
7,2025-07-24,"concept was cool, just wish both mickey’s survived lmao"
9,2025-07-24,Pq o mikey tem voz de autista?
5,2025-07-24,no mickey 007 L
4,2025-07-19,"Buen inicio, mal desarrollo."
5,2025-07-23,"o acting do roberto foi bom mas a história em si estava um bocado atoa, deixou pontas soltas"
2,2025-07-24,long.. beaucoup trop long
9,2025-07-24,I miss my girlfriend. Can't wait for Mickey 18.
5,2025-07-24,random and with loose ends and some things dont make sense
8,2025-07-24,what about mickey 69 eyy
8,2025-07-24,"Watched it the way Bong Joon-ho intended, on my plane screen."
10,2025-07-24,I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT I LOVE IT
7,2025-07-24T13:47:05.911Z,what’s better than one robert pattinson? two robert pattinson. i wish this movie got more recognition :/
4,2025-07-23,"Im generally a big fan of Bong Joon-Ho but this didn't do it for me. So i consider Memories of Murder, The Host and Parasite to be some of the best films of this century and of all time meanwhile Snowpiercer and Okja were entertaining spectacles. Mother didn't really hit the mark for me but was still a worthwhile watch but this is in my opinion is his worst film since his debut. I just never cared for the characters… more"
7,2025-07-24,"Cool concept, strange direction. Pattinson got range tho"
10,2025-07-24,I really don't have any issues with this movie overall a very good time
10,2025-07-24,dihhkey barnes
9,2025-07-24,A good story with just as good world building and set design.
4,2025-07-24,Wouldn’t have flopped if they had a labubu
4,2025-07-22,"Bong Joon-ho, where are you?"
10,2025-07-24,cine
6,2025-07-24,"A história parece ser mais profunda do que realmente é, mas quando você percebe isso você já caiu de cabeça na pedra no raso dessa história, não deixa de ser uma história envolvente com ótimos atores e direção, mas acho que o filme mesmo prometeu mais do que de fato iria entregar."
6,2025-07-24,Weird but kinda fun
5,2025-07-24,"Cool concept and story, and a possible and likely future. Just very forgettable and long"
7,2025-07-24,J'ai adoré le film
6,2025-07-24,Cecdrif Digory está raro.
6,2025-07-24,"“we save you, you kill luco” had me tearing up asf."
7,2025-07-24,Slow start but fun overall
8,2025-07-24,iconic
8,2025-05-16,i realized not to take it seriously quite late in the watch. what an editorial cartoon of a film (in a positive way).
6,2025-07-24,meio malucrazy de se entender mas é legal
10,2025-07-24,(Reseña Pendiente).
7,2025-03-08,Nothing much to say about this except I think the concept is very cool and Robert Pattinson is great (as usual) in it.
6,2025-04-05,"я ожидала большего, наверное поэтому мне и не особо понравилось, тупые шутки, сюжет простейший ничего нового, но спасибо, что добрый конец, единственное, что меня растрогало это эти маленькие червячки, короче оч американизированный фильм, бон джун хо снимал и лучше"
7,2025-07-24,I want a creeper.
8,2025-03-26,"se um já é maluco, imagina dois"
10,2025-07-24,I love robert but i cried all the way through this movie
8,2025-07-24,"Film molto piacevole, nonostante un inizio piuttosto lento: il primo terzo fatica a ingranare, ma la seconda parte risulta decisamente più coinvolgente e dinamica. Ottima interpretazione del sempreverde Pattinson, capace di calarsi con naturalezza nella complessità del personaggio (o meglio, dei vari personaggi). Da segnalare anche un Mark Ruffalo in splendida forma, incisivo ed espressivo come al suo solito. Promosso anche Bong Joon-ho, che riesce a rendere intrigante un film dalla trama tutt’altro che banale: a tratti troppo seria per… more"

6,2025-07-24,daha iyi olabilir
5,2025-07-24T12:50:25.288Z,"The film is alright definitely not my favourite. There wasn't much storyline too it. It is a daft movie that you could would watch probably doing something else not too much thought and attention needed to go into watching this. It is one of them that it is so ridiculous, and insane it make you curious and find humour in that. I do find there is some good important life lessons and points too it. It just not my movie taste and something I would pick to watch again."
6,2025-07-24,I wanted to like this more than I actually did. Would be a flop without RP.
9,2025-07-24,The definitive film of the Trump era
6,2025-07-24,C'etait vraiment pas mal mais vu et revue #jeveuxmonrobert

8,2025-07-21,could have been mickey peak.
8,2025-03-08,elliott smith
8,2025-07-24,"Trusted the creatures from the start and was not disappointed. I was, however, so emotionally distressed because of some scenes I had to hide 😭 Luca,,, Nasha is EVERYTHING and her speech/rage at the end was beautiful. My roommate kept calling Timo, Temu which says a lot. Uh good allegory and metaphors for the political and socioeconomic state of the world, almost felt it could’ve had more (specifically regarding civil unrest). Sinners started playing automatically after this and so if I rewatch it for the third time that’s just fate."
8,2025-07-24,I like this.
9,2025-04-01,There was more than one mickey and that made me think alot about society. This was a good movie.
8,2025-07-24,"very engaging with social commentary, cute lil creatures AND a challengerism scene likeee what’s not to like?!"
7,2025-07-24T12:09:22.742Z,"Mickey 17... total knockout, folks. Sharp, smart, brutal. The elites keep sending the same guy to die.... disposable! Total classism, very unfair. And the political satire? Spot on. Exposes phony leaders, useless bureaucracy... just like the deep state. If I ran that ship, believe me, none of that nonsense. Tremendous film, very intelligent."
8,2025-07-24,Très bien Sah
5,2025-07-21,"Bong Joon Ho deliveres another ""scathing indictment of classism"" except this time he spends $100+ million to do. Other movies of his really have a message and a lesson that can gathered from what's being seen on screen. Mickey 17 falls flat in this area. Everything else about the movie is pretty dang good, but the story is nonsensical with too much down time and not enough reasoning for things to matter. I wanted to love this movie, but could… more"
6,2025-07-24,she said she wish there was two of me
8,2025-07-24,"Ⓘ : This review was written long after I finished the movie/shows, because I am currently trying to catch up on my writing goals. Thus, that's why the date doesn't add up. ─────────────────────────────── Heavy on how important and lucky it is to have someone who loves every version of you. Thank you to Bong Joon Ho, who never fails to deliver a fresh comedy. This movie is basically 'Challengers' if it happened in space and the world is ending and… more"
8,2025-03-09,Je pense je devrais le revoir pour mieux apprécier le film. Robert Pattinson fan account sinon.
10,2025-07-24,Nice movie
7,2025-07-24,cool un peu long
2,2025-07-24,Compared to the source material it was horrible. The flow was bad and the random addition of drug us that was never fully explored ruined it for me.
8,2025-07-08,Énorme plaisir en le regardant franchement à revoir si on me demande
7,2025-07-24,those creatures were kinda cute ngl
6,2025-07-24,Longuet mais histoire originale
8,2025-07-24,dumbass couple made me scream
5,2025-07-24,Robert Pattinson is so good at making weird freak voices
6,2025-07-22,"I just said, ""thank you for dinner“"
6,2025-07-23,"Ganska bra ändå, välgjord och ändå rätt snygg i det stora hela. Det finns några scener som inte är jättesnygga. Det är ju definitivt en bra sci-fi film. Idén däremot är trots att den är bra inte så jätteorginell när man faktiskt tänker på det. Visst är den originell ur vissa synpunkter men inte när man verkligen tänker på det. Tycker pattinson gör det bra.👍"
4,2025-07-24,"Uma bosta Fui ver na maior animação do mundo, e simplesmente uma perda de tempo Que matasse os dois logo de uma vez, nd faz sentido o enredo se perde completamente e o final parece q cagaram na tela e foi isso msm"
6,2025-07-24,"Network, The Breakfast Club, Battleship Potemkin, Mickey 17, you get it."
6,2025-07-24,"A strange mix of sophisticated and unsophisticated storytelling. Enjoyed, but likely won’t ever rewatch. Mickey 18 on top"
9,2025-07-24T10:56:54.224Z,"Pattinson, Butler, Chalamet. Mon big 3 de la génération à venir, très bon film et très original"
7,2025-07-24,i like the concept
7,2025-07-24,I was waiting for the mouse to come out
8,2025-07-24,I mean if i were nasha i would keep all mickeys too
10,2025-07-24,boaf
6,2025-07-24,Suprisengly really good at the beggining but not so much towards the end but I enjoyed watching it
7,2025-07-24,I cannot Toni Collette go how good she is
2,2025-07-24,"Não terminei de ver, filme chato e parado"
8,2025-07-24,I wish the multiples homeless  murder mystery was another film
10,2025-07-22,"despite my confusion and unease at robert pattisons voice and the plot as a whole, i really enjoyed this film"
7,2025-03-06,robert pattinson oscar nom AT MINIMUM
9,2025-07-23,creepers? like in minecraft??
8,2025-07-24,"It was definitely inspired by Dune. But I liked it. It's very good Sic-fi. On a personal level, I think Micky reflects the emotions and personalities we have."
6,2025-07-24,Ending was kind of mid and his dream scene felt a bit random/pointless.
7,2025-07-24,Bien mieux que le surcote sinners
7,2025-07-24,7/10
8,2025-07-20,"I haven't seen parasite or any of bong joon ho's other movies so maybe I'm overrating this, but I had so much fun with this!! Was very surprised to hear it was hated on?? So unique and original, I was thoroughly entertained throughout. This truly felt like a combination of so many different dystopian books/movies we had to read/watch in high school; never let me go cloning for the good of the human race and the ethical questions that come… more"

8,2025-07-24,"L’univers est génial! Une très bonne introduction qui nous plonge dans l’histoire instantanément! Un mélange parfait d’action, d’humour et d’émotion! Je conseille!"
6,2025-03-15,only watched for twink robbie
8,2025-07-17,"Still just as much fun on a rewatch, Robert Pattison does an incredible job and it was so easy to tell the Mickeys apart just through his acting choices."
8,2025-07-23,Mickey 17 is so baby girl coded
7,2025-07-24T09:40:10.964Z,Fully embraced weirdness and satire and Robert Pattinson absolutely nailed his role. Wonder what my gf would do with 2 of me though?
8,2025-07-23,83/100 Bong joon hos entrance into the scifi genre definitely a strange one but this man can do no wrong. Really interesting concept it just takes like the first hour of the movie to set it up
5,2025-07-24T09:27:52.110Z,"Um filme legalzinho mas muito sem sal. Achei esse filme com uma proposta legal a ideia dos clones e tudo mais, so que nao sei dizer parece que esse filme tava cheio de boas intenções, so que entregou um filme sem sal, voce nao vibra muito quando acontece certas partes do filme, e o filme nao aproveita bem o universo apresentado, que parecia bem interessante, nosso batman nesse filme ta bem, acho mesmo que o roteiro do filme é meio fraco e nao ajuda muito ele. Um filme que nao ofende mas tambem nem te deixa mt feliz, um filme fds."
10,2025-07-24,Mickey 18 my glorious king
5,2025-07-24,"In another universe, Pattinson was cast as the Joker."
10,2025-07-24,No sé los quería confesar pero se basaron en mi vida para hacer a Mickey 17
8,2025-07-24,really like the concept but it wasn’t show stopping or anything
8,2025-07-22,Awesome
7,2025-07-24,Bien j’en bien
6,2025-07-24,"Ocupo verla otra vez, nomas me bese con mi novia"
8,2025-07-24,Maldita exploración laboral
6,2025-07-24,ok so robert pattinson is just a freak
7,2025-07-24,Muy entretenida
6,2025-07-24,"Esse filme parece quando alguém decide se dedicar a fazer um powerpoint bem trabalhado: a pessoa pesquisa tutoriais de como deixar ele mais foda, transbordando ideias, botando formatos e animações, só que depois ela cansa então pra não deixar feio termina com a transição do slide virando um passarinho de origami tlg. Primeiramente sim eu sei que o filme é baseado no livro “Mickey7”, mas eu preciso falar sobre o roteiro. Tudo que eu vou dizer é baseado no filme… more"
7,2025-07-24,I damn hope the 16 other Mickeys weren’t as annoying as these fuckers
9,2025-04-09,"Отличный интересный фильм с Робертом Паттинсоном (Микки 17). В этом фильме Роберт Патиссон мне понравился очень неожиданно. Его герои вызывал много эмоции, но понравился тем, что он добрый и стремится к справедливости. Также диалоги были не скучными и графика шикарная."
10,2025-07-24,really loved how effortlessly Ho incorporates class dynamics into this movie. Walked away wanting a baby alien so bad
9,2025-07-24,EAT THE RICH
7,2025-07-24,Bastante entretenida algo bien
9,2025-07-24,"Pretty good, kept my attention. Robert pattinson has some amazing range. Definitely not edward cullen here"
7,2025-07-24,"I liked the movie quite a bit, Robert Pattinson's performance is very good too."
8,2025-06-06,Genieten Het was zo vaag maar echt goed Heb zo gelachen en ook gehuild wat ik helemaal niet verwacht had van deze film
6,2025-07-24,"It could had more potential, still a good movie"
7,2025-07-24,"Absolutely bizarre, but very intriguing. The final act is where it lost me a bit, but man, Pattinson really delivers a great performance. And Mark Ruffalo- lmao. Peak dumbassery right there."
10,2025-07-24,"Fun movie, hard to hate on such a good execution of the concept. Really feels like they fully explored it as far as it could go and then threw in some slightly over-the-top third act drama to tie things together to create some real moral conclusion by the end."
7,2025-07-24,This is a bong hit
10,2025-07-24,so are you telling me that trump will live on until humans migrate to an alien planet in 2054?
7,2025-07-23,"Fun as hell. Middle act drags a bit and the ending is a little too clean, but it’s otherwise a recommended watch for 2025 and a fine addition to Director Bong Joon Ho’s filmography"
7,2025-07-24,"I loved how unique this was and the deeper commentary, despite the silliness. Mark Ruffalo and Toni Colette might be the goat on screen duo"
7,2025-07-24,First half of this movie feels like watching Parasite for the first time. The second half feels like Okja all over again. Not bad but definitely gets wonky as it goes
10,2025-07-24,interesting macaroon store journey
8,2025-07-24,"Weeeyyyyyy perrro peliculon, excelente pinche comedia. Que momentazo cuando le dicen todas sus verdades al Kenneth Marshall. Que personajazos toooodos la putamadre como me divertí. Es una peli pa divertirse y lo logra, debo admitir que al inicio si dije “pa donde va esta madre?” Pero luego me atrapó y no me soltó Que bonito es sentir que invertiste tu tiempo en algo valioso."

8,2025-07-24,Surprisingly really good.
8,2025-07-24,"Robert Pattinson Wow actuación 10/10, el director te da entender su punto de vista de la sociedad hoy en día y del como un líder o presidente de pueblo ve a su gente, una muy buena película de ci-fi te engancha y con actuaciones de 10 de casi todo el cast. Mark ruffalo Wow si que odie a su personaje..."

6,2025-02-12,"Robert Pattinson kind of carries this movie for me. I am not saying that the other aspects and other casts are bad, just, kind of not up to the expectations of a movie created by Bong Joon-Ho. Robert Pattinson really brings a performance of a lifetime here, with two interpretations of Mickey that completely clashes with one another, creating a dynamic that is fun, entertaining, and exhilarating to watch. The other casts are not doing bad either, they're bringing a… more"

6,2025-07-24,weird weird movie. like where do they even come up with this stuff. side note if i had the opportunity to get railed by two robert pattinsons at the same time even batman couldn’t stop me from doing it

9,2025-07-24,It was very enjoyable.

6,2025-07-22,I will never get tired of Mark Ruffalo’s impression of Trump.
5,2025-06-14,"I might give it a 5/10, but there are 2s and 3s I've enjoyed more than this by the end of it. ""Wasted potential"" pretty much sums it up. I was very into the first third or half of it. Let's say five twelfths of it. They build an interesting enough world with a character in a situation I can get behind. I wanted to see where it went, but it goes in one of the least interesting directions it… more"
8,2025-07-24,at the same damn time
6,2025-07-23,"Watched this over the weekend and forgot to log it. Gonna try to get better about this🤦🏾‍♂️ The first half of the movie was very intriguing, but the third quarter was by far the worst. The 4th quarter got better, but overall I enjoyed it."
10,2025-07-24,Filosóficamente enriquecedora e interesantísima. Cinematográficamente atractiva y original. Robert Pattinson hazme un morro.
7,2025-07-24,eu quero dois robert pattinson
8,2025-07-24,esse robert pattinson arrasa
8,2005-07-14,just robert 😵😵😵😵
9,2025-07-24,"ORIGINAL. Simplesmente incrível. Uma proposta original, COM PROFUNDIDADE e muito bem executada. Os personagens são memoráveis e a história possui um desenvolvimento muito interessante. A trilha sonora dispensa comentários, fica ainda melhor quando acompanhada de uma fotografia impecável, que expõe cada sentimento presente em determinada área do longa. Uma composição INVEJÁVEL . O filme consegue explorar de maneira FENOMENAL à melancólica mente do Mickey 17, com o mesmo tendo uma vida triste e repetitiva até conhecer sua amada Nasha. O Mickey… more"
8,2025-07-24,Eu faria impressões de mim próprio pra fazer um surubão
8,2025-07-24,"This movie made me deeply sad for the protagonist. Time after time he experiences betrayal from his own kind - making this film somewhat difficult to watch. Yes, it was certainly goofy, but the film also packed heavy layers of confrontational themes regarding self-worth and modern day capitalism."
6,2025-07-24,Lo único que merece la pena es Robert Pattinson. Es como si metieras a Trump en una nave espacial.
5,2025-07-24,"Es buena, tiene algo que te engancha pero no me parece una película que te cambia la vida NI CAGANDO."
10,2025-07-24,this isn’t the first time a bald man pissed me off. but mark ruffalo??? that’s new

2,2025-07-23,watched the first hour and a half of this more than a month ago and couldn't find the will to slog through the rest until now. mark ruffalo's trump impression is mortifying and every character dutifully moves through plot points like they're checking off a list

8,2025-07-24,"muchos robert pattinson en una sola pelicula…si expreso mucho lo q sentí me denuncian buenisima, interesante en cierto momento medio monótona y me disocie pero bella"
10,2025-07-23,"Robert Pattinson was so 😫 in this. Movie was so so funny, I was gasping for breath at that dinner scene. Props to Robert for his incredible acting between Mickey 17/18. Also, my girl was really trying to get it on with two bad bitches at the same damn time, and that's beautiful."
5,2025-07-23,I don’t know what movie Mark Ruffalo was in but I hated that one.
7,2025-07-23,"Not bad. Not something I’d watch again, but it was an interesting story with some decent comedy bits. Mark Ruffalo and Robert Pattinson were awesome."
6,2025-07-24,"Entendo quem curtiu, mas não me desceu sendo bem sincero, mediano pra bom pq o final salva um pouco"
10,2025-07-24,"i thought i would hate this, actually funniest and saddest thing ever"
9,2025-07-24,Robert Pattinson is either really good at acting or really bad at acting I can’t tell
8,2025-07-23,Mickey 17 is like watching 5 different movies at once.
9,2025-07-24,Biba i boba
7,2025-07-23,What the actual fuck did I just watch. I’m terrified. I can’t stop shaking. But also what an interesting way to explore the dark side of human exploration and heartlessness. I’m glad I watched it?
8,2025-07-24,"Muito bom, incrível como o bong joon ho não erra."
10,2025-07-24,"robert pattinson, bong joon ho, title card drops 30 minutes in — i knew this was gonna be a good one"
7,2025-07-23,The real hero is Mark Ruffalo’s veneers
9,2025-07-24,Like extremely funny
5,2025-07-24,"Muy buena la película,algo confusa ya que no se explica el por qué el 18 tiene diferente personalidad a él 17,dejan algunas preguntas al aire pero creo que vale la pena verla para pasta el rato"
4,2025-07-23,"Really annoyed at how ridiculously silly and satirical this is instead of recreating how smartly the original story approaches philosophical ideas about identity. The book has some dark humor, yeah, but is so much more serious and thoughtful. Why even adapt it if you're going to change this much about the tone? Throw this into the incinerator and do not reprint it."
8,2025-07-24,"La dualidad de voces de Robert Pattinson es increíble. Me gusta verlo actuar. Realmente sentí cuando Mickey 18 se sacrificó: vi esa mirada de miedo, pude notar cómo se empañaron sus ojos. Tenía miedo de morir, pero lo hizo. Fue valiente. Esa escena sí me llegó, y creo que es la mejor parte. ¿Por qué hay gente estúpida que se hace rica? No pude soportar ni a Ylfa ni a ese calvito con piercing en el labio. I just wanted… more"
10,2025-07-24,cuteee
6,2025-07-24,"Fun, silly and maybe a little too much money and freedom."
8,2025-07-24,todavia no he visto Mickey 7 pero aún así me gustó bastante.
10,2025-07-24,"Bro, esta peli me atrapó de una. Ciencia ficción con sentimiento real, sin vueltas aburridas. Visualmente brutal y con un mensaje que te hace pensar. 100% recomendada para los que quieren algo con cabeza y corazón. 😌"
8,2025-07-24,robert pattinson has yet to use the same voice in two separate movies
6,2025-07-24,mina dele loki safada do caralho

8,2025-07-24,Esse filme estava indo pra um lugar muito legal e depois foi para outro caminho meio paia mas a ideia e a crítica é legal
10,2025-07-24,"Me encantó, Robert pattinson y su increíble actuación, amo la película es entretenida, muy buena pero Robert Pattinson es GOD"
9,2025-07-24,actually had me gripping my arm rests on the plane such an interesting concept and was so cinematic and well made.
7,2025-07-23,To all of the Twilight fans obsessed with Robert Pattinson — I get it now.
8,2025-07-24,👍
9,2025-03-15,"Me dió historia, me dió dos Roberts Pattinsons, me dió reflexión sobre mi propia existencia, me dió critica a los actuales gobiernos y me dió mi nueva palabra favorita (prescindible)."

7,2025-07-23,Alright
5,2025-07-23,"I thought this movie was “fine”, I liked the expendable idea but I hated how they made Mickey act. He straight up acted like an idiot and all of a sudden the switch from 17-18 became a smart version? Didn’t make much sense. Other actors were mid at best."
6,2025-07-24,tinha um potencial muito grande e fizeram um roteiro fraco mas robert pattison que ator você é meus parabéns
9,2025-07-24,politico engraçado e brilhante
9,2025-07-23,"Yeah, solo voy a decir q esta muy larga, los doblajes de Mickey son como q no, estuvo bien y me gustó q se muriera el hijo de puta del presidente cagadito, bien ahí"

8,2025-03-31,"Me encanta, Bong Joon-ho es top"
8,2025-07-23,I found both mickeys very attractive for different reasons Also I think Mark Ruffalo’s impression of a Trump-like figure was a little too on the nose and it was a little slow at times for me. very enjoyable movie though
6,2025-07-20,Free the baby
8,2025-07-23,Bong Joon Ho with a beautiful Sci-Fi. The creepers are disgusting and Mark Ruffalo is nuts.
8,2025-07-24,"Me surpreendi com esse aqui, Roberts Pattinson se arrasou muito. Gostei bastante dos efeitos visuais tb, muito zika. Não duvido que num futuro distante aconteça isso de xerox de humano, maluquice."
8,2025-07-23,"funny silly y puedo decir lowkey sexyyy , robert actua tan bien de los dos mickey que me olvido un poco que no es muy buen papá que digamoooss"

8,2025-07-24,robert pattinson did so good playing both mickey 17 and mickey 18 that i truly forgot it was just one man playing both parts and not two different people. also mark ruffalo is hilarious i love that man
6,2025-03-10,wanted more mickeys to show up !!!!
9,2025-07-24,"a fuckin hate letter to the American Government (hard on you, Trump)"
7,2025-07-13,"Acting Notes: Going from playing Batman in The Batman (2022), and then directly to playing Mickey 17 just shows the range that Robert Pattinson has. Imagine his performance in the Batman and then do a complete 180 on that. He speaks in a voice that is very much cartoonish (based off the Ren and Stimpy show), and holds these wild big eyes throughout the movie. If ever needing to play a innocent, weak, or (not to be ironic) but expendable… more"
6,2025-07-24,Longest snl skit ever
7,2025-07-24,I hate seeing Mark Ruffalo play a Tr*mp like character but at least it dies

8,2025-07-24,"Muito bom. Tá tudo ali: o ditador, nossa descrença em ajudar alguém que não pode ser ajudado, a esposa do ditador, hehe, e por fim a redenção, ente outras coisas. Em alguns momentos me lembrou o astronauta do Adan Sandler..."
7,2025-07-23,so wacky
8,2025-07-23,"Si lo piensas bien, esto es un Robert Pattinson de Crepusculo vs Robert Pattinson de The Batman o un Arrival ‘chistoso’. Robert Pattinson me parece que estuvo bastante bien, se me hizo raro su acento como 17 y me gustó mucho más lo que hizo siendo 18. Ruffalo y Toni Collete fueron incomodos de ver (en el buen sentido) pero la gran sorpresa para mi fue Naomi Ackie como Asha, a quien no conocía. El unico problema que tengo es… more"
7,2025-07-23,"So weird, but so interesting."
6,2025-07-23,Sou literalmente o Robert Pattinson.
6,2025-07-23,excellent opening 20 minutes - but it deteriorates progressively into a less and less interesting movie with each additional scene after that. these ideas are not in the same league as parasite - its really not even close
8,2025-07-23,"La actuación de Robert Pattinson es bastante buena y Toni Collette me sorprende cada vez, la amo ¡¿Alguien puede sentarse al frente malditos introvertidos?! it's so relatable"
8,2025-07-21,"Imagina morrer, e voltar? Agora Imagina morrer, e voltar 17 vezes... eu não tankaria. O desenrolar desse filme não é NADA como eu havia imaginado, mas é MUITO bom, uma ficção científica única e diferente gostosa de assistir, com uma história boa e uma direção bem feita, Mickey 17 nos conta nos ensina que todos somos únicos e cada vida é valiosa, e é isso o que nós torna humanos."
9,2025-07-24,Muito bom o filme do primo de 2o grau do Adware 33
6,2025-07-24,This is made for when you want to watch something different

10,2025-07-23,you guys wait 🤭🤭🤭
10,2025-07-23,Robert Pattinson you little freak
6,2025-07-23,There was something so… uncomfortable about watching this movie
2,2025-07-24,Una mierda
7,2025-07-24,I watched this on a Singapore airlines flight and for some reason they dub over the swear words which was genuinely so difficult to watch. It’s a very fun sci-fi comedy and Pattinson does a really good job at playing two characters similarly enough that they’re still the same people and differently enough that the audience can distinguish between them. This bit really makes no sense if you haven’t watched the film. I do think that there’s missed potential with… more
9,2025-05-31,Nasha yo te entiendo

8,2025-07-23,Muito profundo os questionamentos sobre os múltiplos
6,2025-07-23,"Que necesidad de hacer casi todas las escenas sexosas alaberga? Pero bueno, sale Robert no pido mucho. Me gusto que ellos (Mickey y su novia) crearan su forma de comunicarse (con posiciones de sexo pero bueno, quien soy yo para juzgar?). El comienzo de la película lo halló un poco aburrido."
4,2025-07-23,if nasuca valley of the wind was a c tier disney channel original movie….alright bruh🤣
7,2025-07-23,Bien pero no es mi gusto
6,2025-07-22,had higher hopes
8,2025-07-16,went in with no expectations and it was better than i thought
7,2025-07-23,I like it! It was so different and funny and light but at the same time had some very important themes. The acting was great especially from the goat Robert Pattison and Naomi ackie. I will say all the trump adjacent stuff felt a lil too on the nose but maybe that’s the point. I still had fun tho and I really need a baddie like Nasha. Also the two mickeys shoulda kissed.
3,2025-07-23,I think I hate movies
7,2025-07-23,There was just a lot going on This was bizarre and also Robert Pattinson was Naussica There were a bunch of odd subplots that may have been better off as one-off bits

8,2025-07-19,"quizá esperaba ver más terror psicológico, pero días después de haberla visto me pongo a reflexionar que si está muy creepy la cinta. El guion el buenisimo, al igual que la dirección y todos los efectos especiales. Las actuaciones también son muy buenas y no dejan nada que desear. En general es una cinta buena que si recomendaría"

7,2025-07-24,i like the charcters dynamic with the mikey’s. not that much crazy stuff happened but it was still a amazing watch
8,2025-07-23,I'm glad mickey 17 got to live instead of mickey 18 although I thought mickey 17 and mickey 18 might both live but then mickey 18 sacrificed himself at the end which really kind of made me like mickey 18 a lot more because I didn't really like mickey 18 that much since mickey 18 was kind of mean to mickey 17 but mickey 18 did grow on me throughout the movie but mickey 17 was definitely my favorite of mickey 17 and mickey 18
4,2025-07-23,i can’t get over his voice

4,2025-07-23,"Para nada de mi gusto, lo único lindo es Robert"
6,2025-07-24,"Um filme que se perde em uma caricatura do que pretende contar. Figurino, fotografia e ambientação são correspondentes ao filme em questão (como se é esperado) A longa metragem traz uma reflexão muito bem vindo sobre identidade e que faz cada indivíduo único porém infelizmente é banalizada por conta do roteiro que traz de uma forma irônica como a sociedade retratada funciona e os personagens inclusos na mesma. Os personagens que com certeza eu detestei foram o Marshall e Ylfa… more"
6,2025-07-23,only watched for robert pattinson. was it worth it? yes. naisha.
7,2025-07-23,Was I reading the room wrong… or was there a little sexual tension between Robert Pattinson and Robert Pattinson?
9,2025-07-24,"""How old are you?"" ""Mickey 17"" ""How long have you been 17?"" ""A while..."""
8,2025-07-24,"“Mickey 17” foi uma experiência bem diferente, estranha, única, e por isso mesmo interessante. Os efeitos visuais são muito bons, os cenários têm um visual futurista e cheio de detalhes que combina bem com a proposta do filme. E o Robert Pattinson? Simplesmente impecável! ele entrega tudo na atuação. Mas confesso que a narrativa me deixou meio perdida às vezes. A progressão da história é bem desconexa, parece que o filme tem mil ideias boas e tenta jogar tudo de uma vez sem desenvolver direito. Ainda assim, é um filme que vale a pena por não ser genérico, principalmente para quem curte ficção científica."
7,2025-07-23,El filme parece abusar de la duración. Podría parecer algo original en el género de ciencia ficción. Con el selló característico de la crítica de Bong al sistema capitalista. Enorme actuación de Pattinson.

7,2025-07-24,"perhaps a little silly at times but still mickey 17 is an extremely enjoyable science fiction comedy film by bong joon ho who was proven that he is one the few directors out there that can make big budget blockbuster movies and retain an strong artistic voice. mickey 17 is entertaining since the start. the plot moves along blending genres effortsly and the pace is inmaculate. robert pattinson is great as always, now showing a comedic side that suits him… more"

8,2025-07-23,"die, over and over and over and over again. this movie portrays such a romantic view of the fight against capitalism, i cant help but love it. the comedy hits, the emotions hit, the themes hit. pattinson acts his socks off, as always. ruffalo’s impression of a gross billionaire politician wearing a red hat makes me (as intended) sick. the pacing is breakneck, and the film definitely could have trimmed a side plot or two, but this movie ultimately is so much fun to watch, i wouldnt have it any other way"

5,2025-07-23,It was fine.
7,2025-07-24,"são muitas ideias e muitas informações ao mesmo tempo e talvez elas não tenham sido desenvolvidas da melhor forma mas talvez o propósito seja não desenvolver mesmo e te deixar PENSANDO. dito isso robert pattinson gostoso atuação bizarra, mark ruffalo foi tão bom interpretando um ridículo que me deu nojo e a naomi ackie fazendo a mesma personagem de novo"

6,2025-07-23,Funny and nice action moments. I felt like how it ended wasn't that powerful or meaningful as it could've been.
7,2025-07-23,He has a name. He has a soul.
7,2025-07-23,"La película si bien es algo cómica de ver, siento que podría haber sido algo más dramática para meterme de lleno con la historia, porque fue el final que me termino de convencer mientras que la primera parte no veía el problema o tema central que se trataría. Lo que más me gustó si de la película sin duda es Robert Pattinson, aporta tanto dinamismo para Mickey 17 y 18, sin duda de los mejores actores de los últimos años."
6,2025-07-23,Fun saucy movie with 0 allusion to anything happening in the real world at all a total original nothing to do with the real world very funny nothing to do with the real world
7,2025-07-23,couldve been one hour shorter. i fell asleep n didnt miss a thing.

8,2025-07-23,bong joon ho really is that girl
8,2025-07-23,"Mickey 17 was enjoyable. I am glad I saw it in theaters. I think story could’ve gone more loopy with the story but as it was, I enjoyed the concept and characters that made me laugh. The production value seemed very high for how much detail went into this movie & I love one off stories like this."
7,2025-07-23,Can’t wrap my head around the sheer volume of freaky lil voices R Patz can do. You go girl
7,2025-04-11,Liked book better

10,2025-07-23,"I’ll watch anything with Robert Pattinson and anything with Bong Joon Ho. It was my lucky day I love the Trump comparisons, I love the wide reaching commentary (colonialism, capitalism, classism, misogyny), but most of all, I love Robert Pattinson with a funny voice."

7,2025-07-24,"fun But its a pity that Kai´s character was left underexplored. And honestly? There are a few more things. What I call to myself - a soma paradox (after a really good game, SOMA). When you’re cloned - your original body continues to live their life. In the old body. And new body - their life, respectively. In the new one. When your original dies - they actually die. And they’re gone. As good as dead, pun intended. And then… more"

9,2025-07-23,"eh divertido, apresenta boas críticas e muito lindo. gostei da trama do filme e das atuações, robert pattinson mt bem interpretando dois ao mesmo tempo, naomi ackie bem dms e o mark ruffalo, que te faz sentir ódio por interpretar tão bem um personagem tão desprezível"
6,2025-02-20,"Comedia negra + ciencia ficción + director de Parásitos + Robert Patinson = entrenamiento garantizado. Si bien no siento que la vería más de 2-3 veces,es una buena película."
7,2025-07-23,"Yeah the political allegory was extremely heavy handed and the plot was very clumsy, but this was ultimately still very enjoyable. I’d almost have preferred it if it didn’t try to say anything and let Robert Pattinson be silly. He’s very good at it. Also, I like a thoughtfully designed alien."

5,2025-07-23,"Hilarious first 30 minutes, but got stale kinda quick. Aliens were the best part."
10,2025-07-23,Pasé por todas las emociones.
7,2025-06-19,"- daddy robert pattinson takes the lead in this epic space movie. if you wanna see robert square off against clones of himself, then this movie is definitely worth a watch. - mark ruffalo’s role is insufferable. they say he’s an imitation of trump. hmmmm :3 - the aliens were sooo adorable!"
10,2025-07-23,I thought the scene with the two Mickeys in the bedroom was going in a different direction

6,2025-07-23,5.5/10 This film is way too long and got way too ridiculous for its already wild concept. There is a love story somewhere in this but it’s disguised behind all the symbolism. A metaphor for class. A metaphor for political corruption. A metaphor for climate issues. I felt like I was watching a film that was trying to hold up a mirror of the world we live in and I wanted to escape that.
9,2025-07-23,i can’t stop cackling at robert’s voice i love it this movie is definitely another message for the world rn that’s all im gonna say
6,2025-07-23,"Watched Mickey 17 on a plane. Super weird but kind of fascinating. Still not sure what the sauce meant, and some scenes felt totally unhinged, but there’s probably some deeper meaning in there about identity or being replaceable. Not mad I watched it, just confused."
10,2025-07-23,"Mickey Barnes como o mundo do cinema é magnífico né encontraram 17 atores idênticos ao robert pattinson Deus está em todas as coisas mesmo que filme incrível pqp, a atuação do robert pattinson eh de se louvar pqp vei. mark rufallo vc eh tão bom que a partir de hoje te odeio. naomi ackie vc eh uma diva parabéns. não tenho o que reclamar amei"

6,2025-07-23,Ehhh :/
5,2025-07-23,"A bit disappointing, as I was excited to see what Bong Joon Ho would do with this coming off of one of the best films ever made in Parasite. Felt like they had a really interesting premise and only spent the first half of the movie exploring it. Robert Pattinson was great, lot of the other performances felt phoned in. There were a couple different interesting plot lines the script could’ve chosen for the third act, and it feels like they created a far less interesting third option and ran with it"
6,2025-07-23,"It never got off the ground for me. I enjoy the ideas, and the execution didn't feel awful, but it also wasn't quite there. Aesthetically, the movie looks great. It felt like the comedy aspect was almost there, most of the time not really doing more than making me occasionally smirk. There's definitely whole sections of this I just kind of checked out. It was a little all over the place. Probably deserves a rewatch at some point, but not quite the movie I wanted out of this script."

6,2025-07-23,"Mark Ruffalo got told he bit off more than he could chew so he just got bigger teeth. Robert Pattinson is a really good actor. Interesting storyline, but felt the tone was off. Not a sci-fi thriller and not a comedy. Also a bit long, right?"
5,2025-07-23,weird. it was a little too long
10,2025-07-23,Robert Pattinson never misses. It took me so long to watch this film and I’m so happy that I finally watched it. The plot is amazing and every scene is so interesting.
8,2025-03-07,"Vi Mickey 17 en su momento de estreno y, sinceramente, me marcó. Su mensaje sobre la existencia, la humanidad y la explotación, todo envuelto en un contexto de ciencia ficción con una crítica directa al capitalismo, me pareció algo completamente nuevo para mí. La película no solo plantea preguntas filosóficas profundas, sino que también lo hace de una forma accesible y visualmente impactante. Lo más fuerte fue cómo conecté con el protagonista en ese momento específico de mi vida. Yo… more"
10,2025-07-23,The performance was incredible and the ending of 18 was beautiful
5,2025-07-23,Pick a science fiction movie idea
6,2025-07-14,"Bit of a waste! Bong Joon-Ho’s English movies just don’t have the clarity or edge of his Korean projects, and with Mickey 17 he draws on his worst tendencies. A very obvious combination of the wintry, retrofuture aesthetics of Snowpiercer and the PETA-themed slapstick of Okja, with a big dose of obligatory, on-the-nose class commentary. I enjoyed the space travel aspects, and the human experimentation sequences were effective at balancing cheekiness and discomfort. Robert Pattinson was great, a strange and… more"
8,2025-07-23,"Everybody looked like they were having fun making this one and I think that makes it good. Maybe the caricature is a little too inflated, the premise to contrived to support that bloated feeling, or maybe its all just a practical joke on the movie industry. Idk it was still good."

6,2025-03-15,first half of the movie was excellent second half was shit from a butt
7,2025-07-22,"mickey 17 has a fun sci-fi premise -- cloning as disposable labor -- and delivers it with quirky and fun execution. Robert Pattinson does much of the heavy lifting - he's funny, pitiful, sympathetic, menacing, unhinged, in all the right and entertaining ways. this is similar to the other bong joon-ho films ive seen (snowpiercer, parasite): there is on-the-nose social commentary that i find so boring, and the cinematography and production design feels like i'm watching a made-for-tv film. not great things that hold all three films back, but, here he seems to be having the most fun, and that makes for an entertaining watch."
10,2025-07-23,I watched it three or four times
7,2025-07-23,okayyyy sure! the premise is so fire but its tackling so many things at once that it was so overwhelming but steven yeun oscar when he just brightens up every movie he’s in

7,2025-07-23,Funny
2,2025-07-24,Summary: Bong Joon Ho's Mickey 17 follows Mickey Barnes (Robert Pattinson) as he leads humanity to a new planet with the use of reprinting DNA allowing Mickey to die and be reprinted. Leader of this new age Kenneth Marshall (Mark Ruffalo) clashes with Mickey when an alien species is discovered. This movie was pretty bad. First of all the narration is dull and lifeless it sounds more like audio description for a blind person than the inner monologue of someone's… more

7,2025-03-13,Visually beautiful and who doesn’t love seeing a Tr*mp type of character d*e 🥰
8,2025-07-23,"Certainly, ""Mickey 17"" wasn't as good as ""Parasite"", and this may be significantly influenced by my high expectations for any other Bong Joon-ho film. However, it is a really good movie that I DO recommend for anyone (again), regardless of their film taste. Robert Pattinson as Mickey was a good casting choice for his versatile acting, portraying different personalities for the same character. Additionally, Mark Ruffalo was a pain in the ass 24/7, and that means that he did a really good job during the film."
6,2025-07-23,entire time i was watching this i kept thinking how it was like chainsaw man and i would rather watch chainsaw man
7,2025-07-23,robert pattinson's stupid american accent i love it
7,2025-07-23,This movie was very fun and felt strangely nostalgic. If I saw this when I was 13 it might have changed my life. Happy ending and really enjoyable characters

8,2025-07-23,"“Seems like the whole of this rotten planet was running away from something. Guess everyone’s got money problems.” a kooky, Vonnegut-esque, sci-fi meditation on exploitation, colonization, and the value of an individual, their identity “We shall infest the land.” aside: love Robert Pattinson’s weird little voices man aside 2: between the Netanyahu analogue in Superman and Mark Ruffalo as a Trump analogue in this, this is a novel year for fictional catharsis aside 3: not to complain that it was too long but"

8,2025-07-24,Peak
10,2025-07-23,"Weird and honestly a good representation of when people put too much faith in others. Especially, when you have someone in power which makes you relate to Mickey and the Creepers even more. Also I want a creeper plushie so bad chicken jockey eat your heart out. Robert Pattinson honestly steals the show again the way he’s able to change his personality with 17 and 18 is reminiscent of how Rick Moranis or Steve Martin or any of the b characters actors."
7,2025-07-23,"Niche, interesting, probably wouldn’t watch again"
7,2025-07-23,I wish we could’ve seen more of Mickey’s nightmares. I felt that the story was very interesting but so much was going on we couldn’t delve too deep with any topics.
8,2025-07-23,I love how Robert Pattinson is just a submissive baby boy 😻😻😻

8,2025-07-23,"Buena, humor justo y necesario, pero se perdía de a ratos el foco"
8,2025-07-23,Pretty good. I like Robert Pattinson in this. And it feels like just the right amount of campy. Plus I love Ruffalo’s Donald Trump.
9,2025-07-23,I was smitten by the first frame and by the end of the movie I was like “ who is this beautiful actor” EDWARD CULLEN???? WHAT IS THIS VAMPIRE DOING HERE GO AWAY
8,2025-07-23,"Depois de tanto tempo resolvi assistir esse filme da minha lista. Pensei que seria um filme divertidinho com uma crítica social foda. MAS QUE CRITICA SOCIAL FODA, teve questionamentos sobre a ética científica,mal uso da ciência num geral, charlatanismo religioso, colonialismo, ditaduras, fascismo e até ecologia. E o filme ainda conseguiu me divertir em alguns momentos e ficar triste no finalzinho. Me surpreendeu demais, devia ter visto no cinema"

7,2025-07-23,Cool premise but I feel like it slowed down a lot at the end. That girl that made the tea seemed like a waste of time. Don’t like mark ruffalo.  Still enjoyed the movie.
7,2025-07-23,"Kind of messy… The movie has lots to say but I feel like it gets confused in it’s delivery. This movie has lots of moving parts and early every plot thread starts off very grounded and interesting. We’ve got you standard debt crisis, the idiocy of political leaders, the influence of the church, the cowardice of science, and a bunch of weird morals with human cloning. That’s before we get to the native life on the planet. Unfortunately as you… more"
