2025-07-21,3.0,"I was constantly pulled out of the movie by its heavy-handed, self-serious commentary on our world; The imagery and acting seem like they should be in South Park or Saturday Night Live. I endured the 2 hour 17 minute runtime just to see if it ever crossed into So Bad It's Good territory, but I just finished wishing I'd quit to go do some laundry."
2025-07-21,1.0,"In Tropic Thunder(2008), there was a very sound suggestion offered by Kirk Lazarus, concerning what to avoid in order to preserve a good and comprehensive character. This movie needed it like a good educative slap on the face in the moments of total absurd."
2025-07-19,8.0,"Mickey 17 entrega uma ficção científica bem executada, com ritmo ágil e sequências que prendem a atenção. Bong Joon-ho equilibra drama e comédia na medida certa e faz sua tradicional sátira à elite, embora aqui isso fique restrito ao universo do filme, sem ecoar muito além da tela.

Robert Pattinson brilha interpretando várias versões de Mickey, cada uma com sutilezas próprias que impedem a experiência de se tornar repetitiva. A direção de arte e o design de som são competentes, assim como a trilha, que embora discreta, acompanha bem a narrativa.

O grande “porém” é que o filme cumpre o prometido, mas promete pouco. A estrutura narrativa é bastante familiar — falta aquela inovação que faz um sci-fi se destacar. Mickey 17 exige atenção para captar suas nuances; sem isso, pode parecer só mais um título futurista de catálogo."
2025-07-18,8.0,"While the movie's story is a little messy it's carried by strong acting performances. 

Robert Pattinson steals the show with his performances of the different variant Mickeys. The mannerisms of 17 & 18 are so well acted and edited that you almost forget your watching the same person. It takes a lot of talent on both the acting side and behind the cameras create this flawless execution.

The story itself went smoothly in the first half but kind of branched into one to many themes for me at the end. While it wasn't bad I think it may have been not exactly how audiences thought it was going to end.

I really like the relationship Mickey built with Nasha. It felt genuine, especially when she was there for him dying so many times.

Sinners and Mickey 17 certainly set the standard of what good looks like when it comes to one actor portraying multiple lead characters."
2025-07-18,1.0,"Naomi Ackie ruined the movie. We need to stop this absurdity of giving leading roles to actors who can't act and have no charm. If this continues, Hollywood has no hope."
2025-07-18,7.0,"just wish it had more  .. 

it was quirky and strange and really wanted more of that ... decent film tho with good acting all around."
2025-07-18,6.0,"I had high hopes for Mickey 17 as Bong Joon-ho’s follow-up to Parasite. While it was well-acted and visually impressive, it ultimately felt lacking in thematic depth. The film touches on numerous philosophical questions, but they are never explored with the level of impact they deserve."
2025-07-18,3.0,"What a dismal slog of a film.  The book, now.  The book is great.  Sharp, funny, realistic, it's an excellent work of sci fi.  But this?  Wretched.  Why?  Mickey, in the book, isn't a whimpering moron.  He dies plenty, sure.  Mickey's not an action hero.  But he seems human and capable, and intelligent enough to help drive the plot forward.  In the film, he's utterly incompetent, a drab nothing.  In the book, the villain has complex and realistic motivations.  In the film, the villain is a two-by-four to the forehead stereotype, a bludgeoningly obvious Trump surrogate.  The screenplay reads like it was written by a twelve year old who's just discovered profanity.  What was a fine work of science fiction now has all the subtlety of a two hour and fifteen minute Power Rangers episode.  Oy, what a disappointment."
2025-07-17,7.0,"Before this, I had only seen one film by the legendary director Bong Joon Ho - ""Parasite"", so naturally, I expected Mickey 17 to follow the same tense, thrilling, and unsettling tone. But to my surprise, this one felt much more light-hearted and unexpectedly fun to watch. That said, it still carried Bong's signature commentary on human nature, exposing the darker sides of power, exploitation, and how tragically humans can treat those they deem inferior.

One of the standout aspects for me was Robert Pattinson’s performance. Playing multiple versions of himself, he once again proved his range and commitment, effortlessly shifting between personalities and emotions. He just keeps delivering, doesn’t he?

While the film isn’t flawless, Mickey 17 is an entertaining ride, a unique blend of sci-fi, humor, and existential drama that keeps you engaged and thinking long after the credits roll."
2025-07-17,2.0,Could have been an email.
2025-07-17,9.0,"""On Earth, nothing was working out, and I wanted to get the hell out of there.""

Impressive.

Weird, entertaining, and very well executed. Bong Joon-ho excels at creating this deep dystopian world, full of meaning and coherence.
Excellent performances, especially Robert Pattinson's, who once again showcases his acting versatility.
I enjoyed the first half much more than the second; even so, I consider it a very good and fun movie. Totally recommendable."
2025-07-16,5.0,Robert Pattinson and Naomi Ackie are the only things saving this movie from being in my trash list this year. Wonderful acting on their part but the movie feels like it has been re-written dozens of time. It lacks consistency in themes and ends up exploring none of them.
2025-07-16,6.0,"It was pulpy and well shot, and while the idea was interesting I didn’t find the movie as interesting.  It felt like the movie bit off slightly more than it could chew"
2025-07-16,7.0,"Really fun movie, especially if you're looking to shut your brain off for a bit and just enjoy an interestingly bizarre journey. As is tradition, Pattinson displays top tier acting. Mark Ruffalo is easily the worst part of this move. His character is written decently well, but he is clearly doing a very uninspired and pitiful Trump impression that isn't even suitable for SNL. They should've cast Shane Gillis instead."
2025-07-14,7.0,"The concept is pretty cool, and the inner workings of how the concept is explained is gritty. Pattinson pulls off another great role and delivers in every way and then some. While the plot seems to trail off a bit, the performances help in the end."
2025-07-14,6.0,Good and interesting but plot side tracks. Acting is good
2025-07-13,10.0,"No entiendo porque muchos critican esta película como mala. Yo opino que los que lo hacen no les gusta pensar, y ni siquiera te tienes que esforzar tanto para entender, nos hace cuestionar como humanidad quienes nos están dirigiendo personas estúpidas sin humanidad. Y ni una mínima idea en muchos sentidos.
Aparte de eso la película es entretenida y divertida para mi,  estuve pegado todo el tiempo pensando en lo que podría pasar, para mi eso hace a una película buena una que te saque de la idea de tu cotidianidad. Y te plantee cosas interesantes, más de una vez me hizo soltar una carcajada es un humor que no se si todos entienden pero en lo personal se me hizo muy bueno, si lo logras entender lo vas a disfrutar mucho. Y la pasaras muy bien. No se me hizo tan explícita o vulgar siento que muchas personas soportan mas acción cruda como john wick y que no tiene tanto sentido ( a mi si me gusta)"
2025-07-13,4.0,"meandering and directionless at times, too much farce and its sci fi setting felt strained.  Some of the set pieces felt like they were lifted from a stage play.  I got so bored with some of the lengthy scenes (that were mostly unnecessary) I got up and started cooking dinner ...... unfortunately a bit of a yawn fest by the time the 3rd act kicked off."
2025-07-13,4.0,"Good performance by Robert Pattingson, Besides that, not a good movie. Naomi Ackie is insufferably bad at acting & the movie was dragged out far too much. Don't recommend."
2025-07-12,8.0,"I liked it a lot. A perfect comedy sci-fi film. Also Mark Ruffalo steals the show. 8/10 for me.

Underrated but well worth the watch."
2025-07-12,8.0,"Honestly a very refreshing, original concept this whole film was! Pattinson was great, as well as the rest of the cast. Hoping there’s a sequel of some kind eventually."
2025-07-12,4.0,The concept of the movie was good.  Pattinson just didn't do it for me.
2025-07-12,1.0,mark ruffalo acting horrible
2025-07-11,7.0,"Visually stunning and narratively ambitious, Mickey 17 is a bold, cerebral sci-fi ride with a surprising emotional core. Robert Pattinson delivers a layered performance that’s equal parts existential and endearing, grounding the film’s high-concept ideas in real human stakes. Bong Joon-ho blends philosophical depth, dry humor, and striking world-building with his trademark genre-bending flair. While the pacing drags in a few spots and some ideas feel underexplored, the film sticks the landing with style and substance. Thought-provoking, weird, and quietly powerful. Mickey 17 is a clone story that’s anything but copy-paste."
2025-07-11,7.0,"Tiene una duración absurda y en mi punto de vista pudo ser más corta pero memorable, es una buena película, pero si es algo pesada que no me dieron ganas de repetirla durante un tiempo."
2025-07-10,2.0,"It had okay parts, but on the whole it was just a kludged mess, like they had 3 decent movies and cut them into one bad one. Inexplicable and useless characters left and right, pointless plot threads that come up and are dropped, even the core mechanic of the story is basically completely irrelevant for most of the story. 

I'd seriously give it a 1/10. And that's rare for me. Pattinson's decent performance can't make up for an awful, nonsensical story that doesn't even really make you think."
2025-07-10,5.0,"Not sure what I expected going into this, but it wasn’t what I ended up seeing. Interesting premise executed oddly. The movie was trying to be funny at times when it shouldn’t have. Also, Robert Pattinson’s accent just annoyed me in this."
2025-07-10,10.0,"I believe Bong Joon Ho has become a master director. The first film he directed and that I saw was Parasite. I was blown away by his directing, the production, cinematography and acting. A S. Korean friend who also enjoys Parasite told me that the class differences, their style or ability to live is spot on.

When I watched Mickey 17, I was not disappointed. Robert Pattinson is a marvelous actor, as are the big-name actors-in fact, the entire cast.  Bong Joon Ho’s ability to envision a dark future is exceptional.

I have watched as many of the director’s films as are available and he has become better over time. What’s next?"
2025-07-10,7.0,"Mickey 17 presents a thought-provoking sci-fi premise with intriguing ethical dilemmas and a visually captivating world. Though some narrative threads feel underexplored, its ambition and atmosphere make it a solid watch for fans of speculative storytelling."
2025-07-10,7.0,"Bong Joon Ho’s latest sci-fi entry comes in the form of the adapted Edward Ashton novel, Mickey 17 (the book is called Mickey 7 but Ho wanted to add more deaths for the titular character, hence naming it Mickey 17).

Robert Pattinson stars as Mickey Barnes, a down on his luck individual who gets the most unwanted job possible, an “expendable”, where he is utilised to go on the missions no-one else wants and coming back to life with a high tech cloning machine. Pattinson does a stellar job portraying the many versions of Mickey. From weak and timid to a complete psychopath, Pattinson’s range is highly entertaining to watch.

Coming off the back of an incredible performance in “Blink Twice”, Naomi Ackie plays love interest and badass soldier, Nasha. Ackie does a terrific job throughout the movie and carries her action sequences (albeit not that many) well. Mark Ruffalo and Toni Collette play Kenneth and Ylfa Marshall, two politicians whom are clearly based off POTUS Trump. There comedic timing is so good and they make it very easy to hate them throughout the movie.

The set looks fantastic and easily draws you in to the sci-fi world Bong Joon Ho is establishing.

There’s some great humourous moments throughout, especially from Pattinson’s character as he fears death and simply wants to live a normal life with his girlfriend Nasha. I loved the creature design as well. Reminded me of a mixture of the beetle-like bugs in “Starship Troopers”, “Okja”, and an Elephant.

Whilst I enjoyed the movie, I wasn’t as captivated as I had hoped. I’m a fan of Bong Joon Ho’s work but this hasn’t become a favourite.

7/10"
2025-07-09,2.0,"One of the worst movies I’ve seen in years. Acting was crap from Mark Ruffalo and Robert P. The aliens were very cool though —  it gets a star for those effects. So, so difficult to sit through."
2025-07-09,6.0,"Although not Bong Joon Ho’s finest work, such as his acclaimed films Parasite and Snowpiercer, Mickey 17 showcases Robert Pattinson’s exceptional acting prowess, transcending his previous roles in the Twilight series as Pattinson performances are a delight that seamlessly blends humour and engagement with the film’s tone. Moreover, Bong Joon Ho’s meticulous craftsmanship in crafting this original film is commendable. However, the film’s overall atmosphere suffers from a lack of depth, with Robert Pattinson’s performance serving as the sole beacon of light. Unfortunately, the rest of the film fails to fully capitalize on the potential of its setting and narrative.

Grading: B-"
2025-07-08,9.0,"Mark Ruffalo channeled his inner Jack Nicholson, Nic Cage and Danny McBride and chews the scenery like a wood chipper! The indigenous creatures were very well-rendered and the realistic look helped the film. Way better than I thought it would be."
2025-07-08,8.0,Great story line! Nothing like it and was something fresh and new to watch! 4 star!
2025-07-08,7.0,Robert Pattinson is such a good actor. Easily the best part of this movie.
2025-07-08,4.0,I was so looking forward to this but it was a huge disappointment. An interesting premise suddenly changed into a predictable coloniser movie while simultaneously throwing shade at Trump and his idiot followers. Mickey switches between simple and wise with his voice becoming unbearably grating every time he goes into stupid mode. The director would have done better to stick to the original book material.
2025-07-08,8.0,"One of the best movies I've seen in 2025. A movie that reminds us that the life is short and we need to live it the best that we can. My congrats to the director for making this great movie. 8/10, one of the best Blockbuster-Type movies ever."
2025-07-08,7.0,"Acting was phenomenal, story line was engaging, delivers on what’s presented in the trailer. Fun movie, well worth the rental."
2025-07-07,7.0,Enjoyed the film but it feels like something was missed and I can’t put my noggin on it. Definitely worth a watch and forming your own opinion on if this is just a dark comedy or something we blissfully ignore in the real world.
2025-07-07,9.0,"Expertly blends sci-fi and social commentary with a compelling story, allowing for independant thought about its lesser explained facets during its admitadly lengthy runtime."
2025-07-07,10.0,I really enjoyed this film and the work that was put into it. I'm confused as to why so many people leave harsh reviews and I suspect they weren't paying attention or didn't finish it. I was lost in this ugly universe! Robert Patterson crushed it and I didn't even recognize him until I looked up the cast. Mark Ruffalo was also great at playing a character I hated even more than Deloris Umbridge! The rest of the cast was also great!
2025-07-07,6.0,"I enjoyed this, but it seemed a little long. I think Robert Pattinson did a great job though, and it was easy to see the distinction in Mickey 17 and 18. There were quite a few political parallels to current day, but I don't believe they would move the needle one way or another for any viewer. I think there was a deeper philosophical meaning that could have been explored a bit more, but stopped before we went too far."
2025-07-07,5.0,Original but boring.
2025-07-06,2.0,"This film seems intent on making a meaningful point through its casual, almost cavalier treatment of life—but instead, it left me feeling deeply uneasy. While the premise holds real potential and appears to aim for satire, the execution misses the mark, coming across more as a glorification of life’s devaluation rather than a critique of it. Ultimately, it’s a strong concept that’s undermined by clumsy and ineffective storytelling."
2025-07-06,10.0,"A strange and satirical joyride of a movie. With a twisting plot line that reaches for a bit of everything and through line of accepting others regardless of species while lambasting corporate greed and cultish following this was fun to watch and re-watch.

The first movie in over a decade that made me cry out in fear and horror. It evoked tears and laughter and the ending will stay with me for years. I cannot recommend it more highly."
2025-07-06,7.0,There's some good science fiction despite the inexplicable straying from source. Well acted. Almost has a few coherent things to say. Happy but weak ending.
2025-07-06,8.0,Make sci fi weird again!
2025-07-06,2.0,This movie is incredibly unlikable.
2025-07-06,4.0,Might have been edgy 40 years ago. Now just convoluted and cheesy. Pattison was good though.
2025-07-06,7.0,Its like a 3.7/5. Good but a little too long.

2025-07-05,3.0,Cool premise and a totally different side of Robert Pattinson.  Started off alright but then quickly drags in the middle of the movie.  The political satire absolutely was the final nail in the coffin.   What could have been a fun film ended up boring and trite.
2025-07-05,10.0,"Absolutely excellent! Robert Pattinsons acting is beyond phenomenal. The story was entertaining, hilarious and thoughtful."
2025-07-05,4.0,"Such a cool premise, but what a stupid movie…"
2025-07-05,6.0,"Filme ousado, porém extenso demais, no final, acaba cansando."
2025-07-04,6.0,"HBO is lying when they say this is a comedy, it's not. It has funny moments, but it's not a comedy. I thought it was a well made and acted movie with some mostly good cgi. The writing is good but they story was a little long and should have been cut down a bit. I think it would have flowed better. I think Robert Pattinson does a great job and Mark Ruffalo cements himself as a great bad guy with this and Poor Things. The themes the story was getting weren't hitting me over the head with metal baseball bat, more like a foam one but could have been a little more subtle. Overall, I had good time but definitely felt the run time. Not going to really think about rewatching this one"
2025-07-03,4.0,"Every idea felt executed without a clear plan. The characters were unique but would fall to cliche. Often times laughing at and not with the movie. 

This is a good date movie though because if you miss a scene chatting or laughing it doesnt matter at all."
2025-07-03,7.0,"A film that flirts with greatness from start to finish, but never quite gets there. It tries to do too much and just ends up being frustrating at times for not sticking to the parts that make it good. They bring back plot points from the beginning that don't need to be there and don't really add anything of value to the overall story. The silly gangster plotline should've just been left on earth. 

Mark Ruffalo is a cartoonish villian who is clearly a parady of Trump, even down to his supporters wearing red hats. While he captured the man's idiocy and ability to be controlled by the people around him, he just never feels like a fully fleshed out character.

It's a decent movie overall, but I think it's how close it came to being great that takes it down a few notches."
2025-07-03,3.0,"Mickey 17 is slow and uses a bludgeon to tell its social commentary. Look for no subtle touch here , You will want to read email while watching this mostly boring and tedious movie ."
2025-07-03,10.0,"Entertainment that through well-used comedy, shows the many cruelties of humans towards animals, using the excuse of science to benefit themselves, whether with power, wealth or anything else that “indicates” their own navel. and the title already makes an allusion to an animal widely used in laboratories, and “trademark” of a large film company, since from the name Mickey 17, if we take the number and put “Mouse”, we have…"
2025-07-02,8.0,"Good movie — it’s as if Star Wars and Interstellar had a bizarre baby. The cinematography is beautiful, but its blend of genres might feel a bit heavy for some. However, Robert’s performance is truly commendable. It’s a very good film with a unique vibe that doesn’t quite stand out because it doesn’t seem to know what genre it belongs to — but even so, it’s an excellent sci-fi movie."
2025-07-01,4.0,"A cluster of over narrated and underdeveloped themes and ideas overwhelm the screen, until all that remains is a bonkers fun Ruffalo performance and a fine Pattinson one."
2025-07-01,5.0,It was a very long weird movie that I could never really tell if I was enjoying it or not?
2025-07-01,1.0,"Started watching this on 3 occasions based on my normally trustworthy sister, who liked it.  Loved Parasite but this attempt at a movie is just insultingly stupid."

2025-06-30,8.0,"I liked it, but I was really expecting a different story, something that explored more of the premise, instead it shifted to an alien animal rights story that just happened to have two Pattinsons."
2025-06-30,10.0,Great “popcorn” movie. Theres some wasted potential as this couldve been even better as a tv show. This wont have you at the edge of your seat or become your top favorite but its very entertaining and you wont regret putting it on.
2025-06-30,6.0,Could have been better. Sometimes got boring but was alright for the most part. Robert does great work in the movie.
2025-06-29,8.0,"An interesting film, as well as an interesting way of showing how to make a film in which there are diverse characters without annoying a quarter of the world. Worth recommending with a terrifying vision of immortality."
2025-06-29,7.0,Similar tone of farcical sci-fi as Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy/Breakfast of Champions. Lots of Rob Pattinson. Mark Ruffalo as a Marlon Brando/Txxxp combo. Nature shows up in the form of some big tardigrade-esque vermin.
2025-06-28,4.0,"It started out great, but went way too long.  Yeah, we get it that he is killed over and over and over and is reginerated.  I just found myself getting very bored after the first 45 minutes.  Only watch this one if you are bored out of your mind and have absolutely nothing else to watch."
2025-06-28,2.0,"Mickey 17 is a high-concept sci-fi with vast ambitions and beautiful visuals, anchored by a strong lead performance from Robert Pattinson. Yet its execution feels fractured—an uneven blend of existential rumination and cartoonish political satire. Mark Ruffalo’s cult-like villain, intended as biting parody, instead overstays and distracts. The narrative feels bloated and tonally whiplash-inducing: a film on the verge of brilliance that never quite coalesces."
2025-06-27,7.0,"Why does Mickey sound like Peter Parker from the first spider-man lol Timo bro help my man out instead taking his crap what a “great” coworker lol. I wont lie that is terrible only being used as an expermient and just keep dying over and over bro thats so freakish and what about how Mickey feels I know I would feel used and unloved will not catch me doing this.

2025-06-27,10.0,I thoroughly enjoyed the film. The entire cast was great.
2025-06-26,8.0,"“Our entire life is a punishment.”

Mickey 17 is another prime example of Bong Joon Ho’s remarkable ability to craft a film rich in social commentary and thematic relevance. A film that heavily satirizes the current state of politics, Mickey 17 does not fear touching on subjects of capitalism, corruption, and colonialism. Blending the genres of comedy and science fiction, Mickey 17 maintains a lighthearted tone despite touching on such heavy subject matters. Bong Joon Ho delivers his most science fiction story yet, though there are some interesting similarities to The Host and Okja, and I can certainly see Mickey 17 be one of Bong Joon Ho’s most polarizing films. With its fair amount of ridiculousness, there are moments where the humor does feel a little too jarring to the overall story. However, the performances throughout Mickey 17 are fantastic. 

Robert Pattinson shines as both the lead role and as a supporting one. Delivering two great performances, it becomes more apparent that Robert Pattinson is one of the most talented actors working today. While Pattinson delivers the best performances in Mickey 17, Mark Ruffalo delivers the most memorable one. Ruffalo is entertainingly ridiculous in his performance that satirizes corrupt politicians. Through his silly mannerisms and comedic facial expressions, Ruffalo highlights a career standout performance. The supporting performances from Naomi Ackie, Steven Yuen, and Toni Collette also contribute to the overall success of Mickey 17. The dynamic between Naomi Ackie and Robert Pattinson is crucial to the heart and emotion of Mickey 17, but it’s Bong Joon Ho’s ability to infuse an emotional connection between the audience at the “Creeper” creatures that is the most impressive. 

Overall, Mickey 17 is Bong Joon Ho’s longest film, yet there is no dull period and the film flows smoothly. With brilliant visual effects and beautiful cinematography, Mickey 17 is science fiction storytelling at its most interesting. Robert Pattinson is phenomenal and Bong Joon Ho brings out one of the best performances of his filmography. With Bong Joon Ho writing the adapted screenplay and directing the film, Mickey 17 is explosive, exhilarating, and dynamic."
2025-06-26,6.0,"The work manages to bring good and current political criticism, but the plot that structures it, in general, is not that exciting."
2025-06-25,7.0,"More about the reviews here than the movie itself:
This movie is based off a book that the author began writing in 2015, and released in 2022. The movie is by a *South Korean* writer / director.  If you're finding some parallel to an *American* political situation, art allows you to find relevance and relation in your own life. However! Not everything is about the US or the current moment! This place is not the center of the world, and this is not the only point in time to ever exist!"
2025-06-25,7.0,Interesting premise and Robert Pattinson is excellent. I not so subtle social commentary wrapped in an absurdist blanket. Over all I enjoyed the movie but it lost its way and could really use an edit. 100 - 110 minutes total would make a better movie.
2025-06-25,8.0,"La pelicula es muy buena y cumple con todas las espectativas, una buena critica social, un buen contexro y buenos personajes."
2025-06-25,3.0,"While many seem to praise this film as some sort inspired social commentary, those people must lead very sheltered life.  What started off as a fun concept, and a beautifully told dark comedy, turned into banal predictable garbage.  One of the worst films I've seen this year.   The popcorn score really let me down on this one.   Maybe you need to be high to make it good?  Not for me."
2025-06-24,6.0,"Love this director (Mother/Parasite!!) but while some of the premise was certainly creative, the main characters and story were a bit watered down by (Big Hollywood) some commercial and political pandering - lost its focus."
2025-06-24,10.0,"Explores a variety different themes, many see that as a flaw but I believe it is a strength. It is important to realize that all these issues, technological, political, environmental, are deeply interconnected. I hope this film ties it all together for someone."
2025-06-23,1.0,Razzie for the worst actor goes to Mark Ruffalo
2025-06-23,8.0,Entertaining and light hearted
2025-06-23,7.0,I like it enough to recommend it.
2025-06-22,10.0,I loved the storyline. I just hoped i saw mickey's life before getting caught by the loan shark and selling macaroons. Loved it.
2025-06-22,9.0,Ok so I went into this thinking it was a movie about Mickey Mouse turning 17 but instead what I got was an amazing sci fi movie with a lot of heart. Edward has gone from being a vampire to being a lovable goofball. Highly recommended.
2025-06-22,6.0,"Definitely worth watching, it's pretty entertaining, just not much to it.  Pattinson does a great job playing different versions of himself, and there are some funny scenes.  Ruffalo is clearly playing Trump and Hollywood is starting to play that hand too often.  Get something new."
2025-06-21,7.0,"Great acting. Fun story. These are the type of original stories we need more of. Yes I know its from a book, but its not another reboot sequel garbage that dominates the muliplex."
2025-06-21,6.0,Robert Pattinson was great but Mark Ruffalo was so so so bad. One of the worst performances since Madonna was in a movie. Terrible. I enjoyed the movie but It would  have been more pleasant to remove my knees with a cheese grater than watch Ruffalo.
2025-06-21,4.0,Mickey17 has an interesting premise a great performance by Robert Pattinson and not much else. The plot is stretched far too long and meandering. The films social commentary attempts to tackle far too many subjects but only exploring a few with any depth. Mark Ruffalo overacts which leads to a villain you cant take seriously. You cant get invested in either the plot or any of the side characters. It certainly is a unique risk but that's where the films merits end.
2025-06-21,8.0,"We should have more movies like this - interesting, quirky, inventive, surprising in places. The ending isn't great, but I very much enjoyed the ride."
2025-06-20,8.0,"I really enjoyed this movie. It reminded me of ""Alien,"" but with a good sense of humor. The acting was good with great performances by Robert Pattinson, Mark Ruffalo, and Naomi Ackie."
2025-06-19,4.0,"There’s just no signs of intelligence in Mickey 17. I wasn’t really sure what it was trying to say beyond ‘3D printing people might not be humanity’s best idea’ and its entertainment value ended at the annoying characters who seemed like caricatures of other characters.  Mickey 17 is an original idea executed in a formulaic manner that breaks no new sci-fi ground.  In short, it's sci-fi that opened no new doors in the mind. Much of the second half drifted so far from the original premise that it was barely worth finishing."
2025-06-19,2.0,"So so bad. I wish i could get my time back, or unwatch or somehow"
2025-06-19,1.0,This movie is shallow and disappointing. Bloody awful.
2025-06-19,4.0,"An incredible concept, lovely filmography, an all-star cast, but the execution goes off the rails. Somewhere in here, there's the makings for a 5-star movie."
2025-06-18,5.0,"I liked it... enough. I thought it was charming. Quirky. Gross at times. I'm not blown over, but it was quite entertaining."
2025-06-18,5.0,"A very tedious movie, moves along at a very slow pace.  
Little to no character development. I would have been just as happy with an ending where they all died."
2025-06-17,10.0,I really liked the movie. As I was watching I really did not know what to expect but it was a very nice movie. What I like especially is that this movie does not try to be super realistic but it is just a funny story. It is pretty goofie but I like that :) 5/5 Ofenkäse
2025-06-17,3.0,Somehow worse than the book
2025-06-17,7.0,The definition of good not great. It was definitely funny how much Mark Ruffalo's character was similar to Trump LMAO
2025-06-17,1.0,Started off horribly and got progressively worse.
2025-06-17,4.0,"It's not quite anything it wants to be. Dystopian, tragic, funny, fully baked..."
2025-06-16,4.0,"It felt like a book trying to be a movie, and that doesn't work well. Pattinson does a fine job, but there's no draw to his expendable character."
2025-06-16,6.0,"I thought it was going to be an action comedy movie, but it wasn’t"
2025-06-16,7.0,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""Mickey 17"" (2025) is a movie directed by Bong Joon Ho, who previously made the brilliant ""Parasite"". ""Mickey 17"" is nothing close to ""Parasite"" in terms of story or overall quality of the film. Its more in common with ""Snowpiercer"" (2013). 

""Mickey 17"" isn't a great movie by any means, its not even particularly very good one either - its just, fine one. Strengths of this film is acting by Robert Pattinson - he is really good here in a dual role. 
Mark Ruffalo clearly had fun at poking at Trump  - its on your nose parody. And speaking of a parody - this film has a heavy political agenda, its a political satire but not a particularly clever one. This film also is a science fiction story, but it doesn't take itself to serious. Its also has commentary on cloning. So as you can see, it has a lot of things going on, but sadly it doesn't do neither one of them very well. 

Overall,  ""Mickey 17"" is a very mixed bag. I did enjoy it mostly because its not a predictable by the numbers flick, but its originality isn't done very good either. It's a fine movie to see it once."
2025-06-16,3.0,"An intriguing premise spoiled by one dimensional characters, a meandering plot, and awful pacing."
2025-06-16,8.0,Strong performances by the actors
2025-06-16,4.0,"Visually polished but emotionally hollow, Mickey 17 is a sci-fi film that struggles where it matters most. The only interesting part was the beginning — it hooked me at first, but things went downhill fast. The story quickly lost momentum and just kept dragging. It felt stretched for no reason, padded with scenes that added nothing.

The direction and cinematography are decent, but they can't save a boring, increasingly frustrating narrative. Acting is passable, but with such a weak script, there's not much for the cast to work with. Emotional impact? Close to zero. I was just waiting for it to end.

Stylish but empty — a promising start that fades into a forgettable mess.
*C*"
2025-06-16,5.0,"Despite making movies for over 2 decades, Bong Joon Ho really didn’t burst onto the world scene until he made Parasite, one of the best films of 2019. Maybe the expectations for his follow up were just too high, and while Mickey 17 is certainly ambitious, it seems that even a craftsman like Bong has found his reach extending his grasp on this one. It presents an equally bleak and warped view of the future, where the earth is failing and the only solution is to look for another world to relocate to. Bong has always exceled at social criticism, but it was usually smart and cleverly worked into the narrative. Here it’s so in your face that it becomes distracting and even annoying. The parody of modern-day politicians, one in particular, as well as the other issues it tries to address are so ham-fisted and over the top that they just made me eyeroll. I’m all for taking shots at real life figures and phenomena, but when you go for the easiest targets every time and hit them as often as possible, it just feels like you’re riding a bandwagon. The exhaustive narrations suggestions that there’s so much that they couldn’t work into the film so is just explained to us via voiceover, and the performances range from compelling to downright cartoonish, with Mark Ruffalo, an actor I generally like, giving the kind of performance that couldn’t even be called scenery chewing. I won’t fault Bong for really going all out with this one rather than playing it safe, but I cant help but feel that trying to juggle so many different tones and so many different genres just undermines whatever the films message is. It the script had been tighter, the runtime shorter and the targets less scattershot, it could have ben something special. As it, it’s a disappointing, albeit remarkable, missed opportunity."
2025-06-16,6.0,"Interesting take on the clone trope in sci fi,Mark Ruffalo and Robert Paterson really knock it out the park,the film really only fails in its pacing and exceedingly long run time of 2 hours and 17 minutes."
2025-06-16,1.0,I stopped watching when they made a facsimile Trump and maga the antagonist. Any movie that shoved their politics in your face that hard is not worth watching.
2025-06-16,4.0,I'm invested but I want it to end
2025-06-16,3.0,"Many words could be used to describe this movie, but good is not one of them."
2025-06-15,2.0,"You constantly think,  it's about to get good. 

(It never does.) 

And when it finally gets near a decent ending, it needlessly goes on another 20 mins."
2025-06-15,2.0,Awful. Surprisingly awful.  Do not see it you will regret spending the time.
2025-06-15,2.0,Stunned to see positive reviews here. Read the book Mickey 7. Why Bong took such liberties is beyond me. Took a good story and turned it into crap.
2025-06-15,4.0,I'm writing from the perspective of someone who couldn't get passed the first 10 minutes.  I normally love sci-fi and am especially interested in clone-based films and social commentary. These are all my favorite things.  But this movie was grotesque in its displays of torture.   It seemed clear to me that the torture was supposed to be funny.   If you think human suffering is hilarious then this might be for you.  I was sickened by it and wish I had not seen the 10 minutes.
2025-06-14,9.0,"With its extraordinary premise, one would expect great exaggerations in order to find its hilarity amid the absurd, yet, once more, Bong has created a tale that not only works on multiple levels, it reminds us that life has the meaning we ascribe to"
2025-06-14,10.0,"A super fun Sci-Fi movie with just the right amounts of seriousness, comedy, and heart touching moments. I loved it!"
2025-06-14,3.0,"Wrong director, wrong actor, and probably Bong’s worst movie ever!?"
2025-06-13,6.0,"Mickey 17 starts off decent, hooking you with a creative concept, but it stumbles about halfway through. The acting is flawed, and the long runtime drags as the story gets lost in its own complexity. The female protagonist overshadows Mickey, which feels off, shifting focus from the titular character. Mark Ruffalo’s over-the-top, Hunger Games-esque performance is fun at first but grows stale. It’s not a total misfire—they tried, and the ambition shows—but three stars sums it up for a film that couldn’t quite stick the landing."
2025-06-12,5.0,"As a fan of science fiction I was really looking forward to this movie.   The premise was excellent, but the movie fell short.  I endured the entire film hoping it would improve, but alas, it didn’t.   Truly one of the worst films I have ever seen.  Spare yourself."
2025-06-12,6.0,Very interesting idk the ending was a bit weird loved the story and the beginning
2025-06-12,5.0,"It appears that this movie was attempting to be both a comedy and topical political/social satire with a message of some sort.  It fails at both of these missions.    However, Pattinson's portrayal of Mickey as an endearing useful idiot, almost in a Being There kind of way, makes it an interesting watch.  Had it not been for Pattinson, the whole thing is useless garbage."
2025-06-12,10.0,"Well, that was a wild ride!  Loved it so much.  Not a perfect movie, but the audacity and weirdness made up for any shortfalls, for me, anyway.  Loved Mark Ruffalo, Toni Collette, and Robert Pattinson.  Super fun."
2025-06-12,7.0,"It’s an interesting concept. The acting is pretty good and the story is alright. For a movie that’s meant to be satire, I feel the comedy aspect of the film didn’t carry it enough for how “okay” the story was. Even for the sci/fi aspect of it, the visuals are nothing spectacular. It’s a good movie, there’s some funny parts and the characters are at least a little interesting. Not a movie I’d watch twice, Buts it’s not a waste of time if you wanted to sit down and watch something that doesn’t take itself too serious."
2025-06-11,2.0,"Horrible. Cant say enough how bad this movie was. Pattinson voice and accent were completely annoying and the whole plot was stupid. 
I wouldn’t let my dog watch this movie. 
Turned it off halfway through..and that was in hopes it would get better."
2025-06-11,8.0,The movie question about the morality and ethics in pharma industry. Is one life worth less than many?
2025-06-11,7.0,"Mickey 17 often feels overstuffed with numerous themes and tonal shifts, but it's a unique piece of filmmaking that's a refreshing change from certain sterile Westernized narratives."
2025-06-10,3.0,"Liked the visuals, Sat it about halfway through and decided I was done with it. Did not care much for the characters. Thought M. Ruffalo’s SpaceTrump was tedious and never funny."
2025-06-09,10.0,EXCELLENT MOVIE!! Outstanding cast and outstanding direction. One of my favorite films of the entire year!
2025-06-09,5.0,Strong idea but just loss my attention half way through
2025-06-09,1.0,"Its not a ""social commentary"". Its just clearly making fun of a certain political figure, down to the gun shot wound. I remember when movies werent political. Premise was decent. Execusion was lackluster at best."
2025-06-08,8.0,"Sauces are the true litmus test of a civilization…

I had a great time watching this film. It's unfortunate that it ended up being a box office flop because it’s genuinely original and fun.

Mickey-17 revisits concepts Bong Joon Ho touched on previously, but this time through a more satirical lens.. Even though the story sometimes feels a little commercial or surface-level, it’s still too original to hold that against it.

In the director's classic style there is ample commentary on corporations, labor, and alienation. The visual storytelling in the film emphasizes these critiques and really lets you feel how broken the system is and how disposable people are.

Robert Pattinson is locked in per usual so no one should be surprised here. After showing out in The Boy and the Heron, he brings that same vocal range here which matters since there’s a ton of narration. His physical performance is quite impressive as well…almost Buster Keaton like at times.

Visually, this movie looks amazing. The set design gets five stars alone. I was fully immersed in every location. The snow planet Niflheim, the interiors of the ship, and the courtroom scene near the end all stood out. The costume design is on par also standing out.

I didn't have an issue with Ruffalo and Collette. I actually found them quite funny in the most absurdist way. The characters work for the tone of the film. 

It was great seeing this director work on a scale this big and still bring his own voice. Teaming up with Robert Pattinson was a smart move given his ability to lead blockbuster projects."
2025-06-08,2.0,"Literally one of the worst movies we have watched in a long time. Started out ok, then became outrageous and boring. My husband stopped paying attention about 45 minutes in. We finally fast forwarded to the end. What a waste of time."
2025-06-08,4.0,"Honestly, there’s no need to shout genius with every Bong Joon Ho film. It’s still a social and societal critique, like all his previous movies (The Host, Okja, Snowpiercer, Parasite). It’s kind of like watching the same film over and over. We’re not just talking about similar aesthetics, but really the exact same theme, which gets tiring, because if you take that away from the film, there’s not much left. Bong Joon Ho is basically Mickey 17 himself — a continuous copy of himself, always serving us the same thing without trying to reinvent, without trying to become his Mickey 18.
The initial theme had potential, but in the end, it’s just a backdrop. The film is long. Very, very, too long. Beautiful but boring, basically saved only by a typically Korean humor and style that excuses its empty moments."
2025-06-08,6.0,Quite an interesting concept and story.
2025-06-08,9.0,This movie deserves more praise and I believe it to be a great production from all teams that were involved!
2025-06-08,8.0,I go into sci-fi movies just wanting to be entertained.  I don't need them to be thought provoking.  This movie entertained me.  I would have given it five stars had it been 20 minutes shorter.  The creature (creeper) effects were a bit too puppet like for me but the concept worked.  Feel good ending.
2025-06-07,1.0,mickey 17 was kinda boring
2025-06-07,7.0,Patterson was great and it has a good premise but it was too all over the place.
2025-06-07,7.0,Groundhog day meets starship troopers is the best I can do to explain this one. Worth watching at least once.
2025-06-07,8.0,"Good one, Hollywood does have some innovation!!"
2025-06-06,2.0,"Mickey 17 was released in 2025 and stars Robert Pattinson and Mark Ruffalo in a science fiction / comedy about clones in space. Pattinson was fine in his role but Mark Ruffalo was terrible in what I assume was a parody of President Trump. There's also a lot of political messaging about capitalism and greed that for me fell flat. The CGI was all over the place, the plot meandered, and the ending was predictable. Easy movie to skip."
2025-06-06,10.0,This sci fi movie was expectantly terrific. I loved the Robert Pattinsons were each unique. And whats not to love with this little creatures? Mark Ruffalo was easy to  strongly dislike and it was cool seeing Steven Yeun again.
2025-06-06,10.0,"A rather abstruse theme, but one that carries the director’s vision and deep conviction."
2025-06-06,5.0,Expected more but it was still a silly fun ride
2025-06-06,3.0,"Robert Pattinson did a great job and it was well produced. Still, underneath the flash it's just the same Hollywood preaching that permeates everything. It fails to make original points and dehumanizes the people they attempt to satirize, which is always a mistake in this genre."
2025-06-05,5.0,First off I wanna say that I think Robert Pattinson is a pretty good actor even though he gets a lot of twilight hate. That being said this movie was just ok …Cool story line for sure but there are parts where It gets weird as balls and after over 2 hours of watching the ending wasn’t great. I’ll definitely watch again if I’m bored enough
2025-06-05,4.0,"If you read the book, Mickey 7, and even remotely enjoyed it, do not watch this movie. They took the ""smart"" out of the characters and reduced it to ridiculously basic antics. Really too bad because the book seems completely adaptable to screen.  
If you go into this movie knowing that it is ridiculously over acted and the characters so dumbed down you wonder how they traveled across space to a new planet, you might enjoy it. 
I am saddened that such a talented cast was not given better material to work with."
2025-06-05,6.0,Helt okay. Jeg havde måske bare for høje forventninger til den.
2025-06-04,7.0,"This belongs in the same category as 'Don't Look Up'.

It's not for the Oscar, it's for political satire and B style humor. Wouldn't watch it again, but I'm not mad that I saw it."
2025-06-04,4.0,It was too wierd; despite the good reviews I doubt you'll enjoy it.  Feel free to scroll past Mickey 17.
2025-06-04,10.0,This movie was a breath of fresh air it was funny and a delight .acting was great
2025-06-04,10.0,"I was surprised by the somewhat cold reception this movie has gotten so far. While it’s maybe not on par with Parasite, it was delightfully witty and refreshingly far-from-formulaic.

Easily one of Robert Pattinson’s most dynamic performances, and the actors played off his cartoonish innocence (and later his jaded brutishness) perfectly. 

Though the film walks the line next to absurdism at times, the story itself illuminates the bizarre reality of authoritarian imperialism and classism as it is perpetuated by buffoons in power. If you are sensitive to criticism of people like the current U.S. president and his affiliates (from whom Mark Ruffalo clearly drew at least some inspiration) this may not be the flick for you. Like Toni Collette’s Ylfa, perhaps you are still too lost in the sauce.

All said, I anticipate this will become a cult classic in years to come. Until then, we may be a little too close to the smoldering flames to appreciate Mickey 17 for the fresh life it brings us as an inventive underdog hero story."
2025-06-04,1.0,"You have got to be kidding me, right?  This movie was one of the biggest wastes of talent that I have witnessed.  If only I could get the 2+ hours I spent watching this POS.  I never give credence to critics reviews, but there is an audience that actually rated this with an average of 4 Stars?  You all must be gaslighting."
2025-06-04,10.0,"Robert Pattinson's performance and dark humor receive praise, while pacing issues and underdeveloped characters draw criticism."
2025-06-03,3.0,Entertaining garbage
2025-06-03,3.0,"Desperdiçaram um baita enredo. Dava para fazer um excelente filme com essa história mas, resolveram desperciçá-la com esse tom cômico, abobalhado e infantil."
2025-06-03,7.0,"I loved this movie.  Quirky and funny, great storyline.  Pattinson was really good in it.  Really loved Mark Ruffalo as the OTT vain Trumpesque/Evangelical."
2025-06-03,3.0,"This movie should’ve been about 30 minutes shorter. It started strong. The first 45 minutes of it were fun and funny. But once you get to the halfway point it turns into an absolute drag. Every scene from that point on felt like it was about 2 minutes too long. Hell, the scene with all the worms around the ship, that scene alone felt like it lasted a whole hour. BTW, it says that it was supposed to be a comedy. But it quickly turned into some sort of sermonizing garbage. I went into it with high hopes, but I now see why it didn’t last long in the theaters. PHOBE it!"
2025-06-03,5.0,"Okja meets Moon that could have used more ""dark side of the"" and less silly twilight."
2025-06-02,7.0,"Mickey 17's first half of the movie is brilliant and with great potential for character and plot development. Nevertheless, it fails as many other movies in the excess trap. Watching it makes you reflect. Until the moment you get sleepy."
2025-06-02,10.0,"I was confused, shocked, and above all entertained. 

It's a bizarre and unique take on sci fi that was thoroughly enjoyable"
2025-06-02,1.0,Robert Pattison was great. Mark Ruffalo stunk.
2025-06-02,8.0,"Very unique Sci-Fi Comedy! I thought that the premise of the movie was very unique, the chemistry of the cast was impeccable, and I found the movie funny.  Definitely worth watching for a movie night!"
2025-06-02,9.0,"Robert Pattinson really sells the character of Mickey, I wasnt convinced from the trailer but upon watching the movie it makes alot more sense. Writing is hit or miss with more hits than misses. If youre a fan of a certain president you will most likely dislike this but if youre open minded/a well functioning person you should be able to look past that and enjoy what is a really creative movie with alot of laugh out loud moments. Definitely recommended."
2025-06-02,6.0,"In the future. There’s technology to 3D print copies of people. Mickey is an expendable. A person whose whole job is to be killed and be re-printed. This movie looked cool on the trailer and I was really wanted to see it but it’s very dark. There’s a leader that is very fascist and give 0 F’s about native species. There’s some disturbing scenes of what the do to little aliens , granted they’re made up and cgi but still, very disturbing even to make a point. It clearly shows how humanity is. On one hand disregard for other forms of life for personal gain or pleasure and other that take pity and compassion on other beings. I do not recommend this movie. It’s not funny. The plus sides of it would be that the story is original. Nothing like this I have seen or read. And Robert Pattinson dual performance it’s outstanding 🍿🍿🍿/5 on Max"
2025-06-02,8.0,"Movie is theoretically plausible from a science and cultural perspective, concentrating hard on humanities tendencies to fall in line but also the courage to fall out of line."
2025-06-02,2.0,The first 45 minutes or so were great. It went downhill after that. Mark Ruffalos character is unbearably bad. The story turned out to be boring and forgettable. I loved Parasite but this one was a total miss for me.
2025-06-01,6.0,"It is a good movie but the end of the movie bears no resemblance to the start. The start of the movie focuses a lot on the concept of the printing of Mickey and thematic philosophical questions raised from that. The ending focuses very much on the story of the colony itself, becomes more grounded and drops all focus on anything philosophical. It is a good movie and deserves a lot of credit for it's uniqueness and originality but where it ends is quite different to where it started"
2025-06-01,1.0,"I really wanted to like this. But it felt like the movie was written by two different writers, one that wants to make a quirky and kick ass sci-fi movie and another one that wants to preach politics to the audience.

Writers should never get on a soap box, it breaks the third wall in the worst way possible."
2025-06-01,8.0,Crazy Movie. Not a comedy but very entertaining.
2025-06-01,10.0,"Um dos MELHORES de ficção científica do ano até o momento!! (se não for de fato o melhor, até o momento.)

A caricatura e sátira está bem presente aqui, e feita de uma maneira muito natural e maravilhosa de se acompanhar.

Claro, o ponto da sátira é apenas um dos seus outros incríveis pontos positivos e acertos.

Um baita acerto grande em suas propostas, isso vale pro humor, pra aventura, um pouco da ação, e também no drama.

Longe de ser perfeito, tem sim seus pontos bem fracos.

Mas mesmo assim, continua muito bem com sua identidade.

Ah, e eu preciso dizer que Robert Pattinson está BRILHANTE em seus dois papéis.

Dito tudo isso, um dos melhores que eu assisti esse ano, até o momento.

2025-06-01,4.0,"I was excited to see this, but it didn't live up. Some of it was funny, but for the most part it felt like a chore making it to the end."
2025-05-31,10.0,"Humor and gore, politics and love, supernatural and simple natural.
compelling unique story, unbelievable acting - especially Pattinson's voice changes were all just spectacular! 

I loved how the director kept us engaged with very small details - like the decision to leave the door open during that scene in Mickey's room. 

No Hulk smash scene - booo!"
2025-05-31,1.0,"One of the biggest wastes of time. Terrible acting, not funny, and weird storyline."
2025-05-31,10.0,"I didnt know what I was getting into when watching this movie. Did it hit hard, what a fantastic movie."
2025-05-31,8.0,I enjoy a sci-fi film that when closely looked at you can find philosophical thought experiments to debate. I enjoyed this film.
2025-05-31,2.0,"Mid way through the movie we have Mark Ruffalo hamming it up as a very Trump-like politician and our 'hero' tries to assassinate him.  

How did Bong Joon Ho think including the scene was OK? Has he not watched the news in the last year? 

Regrettable faux pax aside, the movie is just a mess."
2025-05-31,8.0,"It was a fun, imaginative, and titillating journey to the end of late-stage capitalism. The tone felt like old (better) Burton, but really fresh and new. Robert Pattinson was both his usual self and completely different which was nice to see. The supporting cast was superb with a nice mix of fresh and familiar faces (TC = GOAT). My only gripe with the film is that I wanted them to explore death and what it means to die more fully; the fact that it wasn't really Mickey living on, but a copy of him living on. The original Mickey died long ago but no one seemed to really reconcile that. Also, I wanted to see things get really out of hand. There were so many things that could've been explored here, so many moral dilemmas toyed with that were never addressed. I am happy with the story, but I feel it should've been less Avatar-esq and more Rick & Morty. That said, it still gets four stars and here's hoping that someday soon, I'll get to print my very own RP."
2025-05-30,6.0,The film has an interesting concept that I don’t think achieved its potential.  Robert Pattinson fans will probably enjoy seeing him in the film.
2025-05-30,2.0,This was an absolutely horrible movie that I couldn't turn away from. The acting is subpar. The story was a bit ridiculous but I see where they were going with it.
2025-05-30,5.0,"The premise is really engaging but the second half of the movie felt drawn out and it was too easy to lose interest in the world of the film. I understand there’s a comment being made about society in the film, but its attempt at drama and comedy detract from it."
2025-05-30,6.0,"Well, considering the past movies from Bong Joon Ho, I had higher expectations for this flick. The trailer made it look better than I found it to be. 
Interesting and unusual starting premise, good acting performances, but lots of dead moments, and the plot eventually gets lost in some kind of crazy mix of comedy-drama with awkward scenes or goofy moments that leave you wondering how truly useful they are to the main storyline.
Also, the social and political discourse could use some subtlety here. Good intentions regarding social and political issues can't just be patched onto a kooky scifi comedy. The result can quickly become cringe worthy."
2025-05-30,7.0,It has interesting elements and it's pretty entertaining but it becomes boring at the end. It just seems anticlimactic and like they could have done more and better.
2025-05-30,2.0,This is a boring predictable movie.
2025-05-29,7.0,"I really, really enjoyed this movie. It's on the nose clever, well acted by a great cast, funny, exciting and original  it's just a pity the sharp satire is blunted by the last 15 minutes which are unfortunately trite and corny and do the rest of the movie a disservice."
2025-05-29,8.0,Great performances! Loved this
2025-05-29,7.0,"It's not perfect, but what it is, is something you're not at all likely to watch in the contemporary cinematic landscape. I'm grateful for that. It's a breath of fresh air."
2025-05-29,10.0,"A fun, well acted, wild ride!"
2025-05-29,6.0,"It's fine.

 Some  cartoonish performances by Ruffalo and Pattinson that really straddle the line of a great character acting, and just over the top chewing of the scenery. 

Ruffalo's character, and his wife, feel like characters that could have been on Snowpiercer. Felt like we'd seen this over the top, hunger games-esque character and aesthetic before. 

The plot is ok, the movie had funny moments, and it'll keep you entertained for it's runtime. I felt like the entire last 10 minutes, of the dream sequence, didn't add to the movie."
2025-05-29,5.0,"Parasite was always going to be a tough act to follow, and while Mickey 17 isn't exactly a masterpiece, it is a quirky, fun, original space adventure."
2025-05-29,10.0,One of the best Warfare adaptations I’ve seen. It’ll let you know if you need to deal with some spicy dejavú.
2025-05-29,3.0,"First 30ish minutes of the movie was pretty good but then it took a nose dive and became a chore to watch, I definitely would not recommend this movie"
2025-05-29,6.0,Found the enjoyability of the movie ruined by Mark Ruffalo's poor attempt at imitating Donald Trump.
2025-05-28,6.0,"Oh... My hopes might have been too high here. I'm really not quite sure what I was expecting. I guess I might've been expecting something to wow me the same way Parasite did, so that might be my fault. I feel like too much CGI makes me clock out."
2025-05-28,9.0,"Director Bong Joon Ho does it again. Delightfully weird characters as always. He once again has animal a few scenes of animal mutilation harkening back to Okja, but still a great film."
2025-05-28,1.0,Painful. 2+ hours of my life that I’ll never get back. Who casts Ruffalo!?!?   He’s awful.
2025-05-28,8.0,"I began watching this movie with 0 expectations, just another Sci-fi space movie that'll probably have the same plotline structure like all the others, but I was really surprised honestly! Right off the bat it sets the main concept, which was a way more unique idea than I thought it was going to be originally! 
I noticed the casting and without any background knowledge and was quick to judge, yet Robert Pattinson's acting was incredible!!
The pacing of the movie as well does a good job on representing how much they throw away care towards Mickey, slowly seeing him as just a body of flesh to be reprinted. And you do not know hOWW mUCh I appreciated that the movie did not go down the cheating route drama within the scene with the girl from dinner.
Yet the overall pacing could be fixed towards the ending, the rolly polly species surrounding the ship was a littleeee dragged out, but I still enjoyed it!!
They are so incredibly adorable so I don't mind them being on screen for a little while! Definitely would buy a marketable plushie of one lol
Also the character writing of the main villain could be tweaked to be a little lesss incredibly annoying, similar to almost a children's movie villain, he does all this selfish activity for little reason. Though at the same time it does get the viewer to dislike him too, so in the end it still works and we are all rooting for his death!

The photography and film direction within the movie as well was amazing! I found the comedy well written and perfectly paced! I also was quite impressed on the quality of the 3D modeling, and how they managed to stitch up so many scenes with the same actor interacting with themselves so well done!

Overall I really enjoyed this movie and was really happy to see that good sci-fi movies are still being made!!"
2025-05-28,8.0,"Although it’s not my favorite from Bong Joon Ho, the acting was incredible and the storyline felt fresh and original. This movie was a fun and kooky ride, while still leaving you thinking about its message long after credits roll."
2025-05-28,2.0,The movie drags on and on for what seems like a mediocre plot that Robert Pattinson cannot hold up by his multiple personalities. I tuned out after 45 minutes.
2025-05-28,8.0,pleasantly surprised; i went in completely blind & really loved the overall storyline/concept. really well done & everyone played their parts well too. the cast is stacked. i'd definitely recommend it if you're into sci-fi themes.
2025-05-27,9.0,What a fun exciting surprise with a nice message attached.
2025-05-27,5.0,A tale of two halves really. First half is interesting and found the story really intriguing. Second half was silly and really a letdown.  Wish they could have written the last hour of the movie and not made it some silly monster movie.
2025-05-27,4.0,"Joon-ho and company, who along with his 3 lead actors have a combined net worth exceeding $200 million bravely take on the evils of capitalism and religion…yawn. Also, besides Mickey there’s no character development of any kind.  Lazy film, used up topic."
2025-05-27,10.0,"I wish VHS tapes would stay be a thing, so I can take every Rob Pattinson movie and hit the face anyone who says that he is ""that guy from twilight"".

Absolutely amazing performance.
At some moments he was so different from himself that I literally caught myself on thought ""what actor it was?"".

Visuals and plot are strong as well. Highly recommend to watch"
2025-05-27,8.0,"Una película interesante que, si bien deja algunos temas sin explorar en profundidad, presenta una propuesta novedosa y bien ejecutada. Su historia resulta entretenida, ambientada en un mundo desafiante y complejo, habitado por un abanico de personajes tan detestables como entrañables, lo que le da una riqueza particular al universo que construye."
2025-05-26,7.0,It was okay and entertaining
2025-05-26,1.0,Do not waste your time watching this movie….it is over 2 hours long and you will never get that time back!  The acting is so bad and the plot is really thin.  I can’t believe that the critics and audience scores were over 70%.
2025-05-26,1.0,"The only thing redeeming about this was Robert Pattinson’s acting. The movie was absolutely terrible. Just another story of humans invading a different planet and not understanding  the native creatures that live there. Him being printed out over and over could be completely moved from the plot and it wouldn’t make a bit of difference. Just awful plot, awful script, and Ruffalo and Colette’s acting was so atrocious I never want to see either of their faces ever again. It was long, drawn out, meandering, and pointless. It ended with literally nothing having happened. 

Save yourself from 2 hours of boredom. Your time would be better spent taking a nap."
2025-05-26,10.0,"Bong Joon Ho isn't afraid to go weird and this is W-E-I-R-D.  From Pattinson affecting a flat, Buscemi-esque American accent to Ruffalo chewing scenery as a Trump/Musk hybrid trying to install a ""PURE"" outpost on a far-flung planet to Toni Collete as a human lamprey always physically attached to her megalomaniacal husband, this one pops as truly original content.  The overtones sharply mirror what's going on in America and the movie sails by quickly.  I appreciate new directions and this did it for me."
2025-05-26,10.0,Fantastic movie ! Robert does an amazing job and the metaphors go heavy in this film.
2025-05-26,8.0,A good science fiction film. Bong Joon Ho’s follow up film to “Parasite”. Robert Pattinson is a great actor. It takes place in a dystopian future. The monsters bothered me.
2025-05-26,3.0,"Interesting idea. Started ok, but then lost my interest. Had it's moments but too long and too slow. 
Feel like it could have been so much better"
2025-05-26,10.0,"One of my new favorites of Rob Pattinson. Great work and supportive cast! Rob nailed this character, especially sold it with the voice. I would definitely recommend."
2025-05-26,1.0,"Mickey 17 was weighed down by political undertones and an oddly self-assured cast, considering how weak the script is. The villain, a mashup of Trump and Musk, feels forced and one-dimensional. The pacing is sluggish, and the dialogue is painfully simple, often bordering on awkward. Despite its high-concept premise, the film lacks the depth and quality it needs to be engaging. I found myself struggling to stay invested and wishing for a more thoughtful, better-executed story."
2025-05-26,9.0,"it was oddly sexy. Definitely for the ""booktok"" girls. I enjoyed the political message and the Donald Trump like villain. It was comical and not a serious movie but had that one serious message of ""the ones in charge are evil"". I enjoyed it and the aliens were super cute."
2025-05-26,4.0,"Pattinson gives his all, but MICKEY 17 sinks under a tangled, exhausting script."
2025-05-26,3.0,"I really wanted to like this movie but the fact is that it is just, plain, terrible. The a direction, timing and editing is just off."
2025-05-26,2.0,Horrible filmmaking and calamitous writing on full display. Everything wrong with Hollywood ego gone unchecked.
2025-05-26,10.0,"Seen as it is, from a simple perspective, it might hurt seem just a strange movie. But given that this is basically a parody of what is happening in global politics, written by a South Korean, is cinematic history. The parallels to our current reality of idiots declaring other people “aliens” while seeing them as less than dirt, while in fact those people are simply interested in basic dignity and respect, is incredible in and of itself. But the layers represented by multiples and “expendables” really makes it not just relevant to today, but relevant at any point in the future. I’d call this one of the best and deepest movies I’ve ever seen, even though the main protagonist is portrayed as dull and goofy. A cinematic masterpiece"
2025-05-26,5.0,"I couldn’t finish it, just didn’t hold my attention after the first 30 minutes."
2025-05-26,5.0,"Not good, such a huge miss from the book. I was really looking forward to a sequel and franchise, but not now. Mickey 17 belongs in the cycles."
2025-05-26,1.0,"All characters being loud, pointless and obnoxious IS NOT COMEDY!"
2025-05-26,8.0,"Mickey 17 is Bong Joon Ho’s most American and overtly accessible film to date. Full of biting wit, this science fiction satire is an out-of-this-world comedy with philosophical intrigue. As the titular Mickey 17, Robert Pattinson gives a career best performance. Although it lacks a compelling plot to match up to the promising premise, Mickey 17 is nonetheless never boring. This is the definition of blockbuster B-moviemaking. This may not become an awards contender like Bong Joon Ho’s Parasite, but it’s interesting, entertaining, and fun."
2025-05-25,8.0,I really enjoyed this movie!
2025-05-25,6.0,This movie is well acted. Everything else is just okay.
2025-05-25,4.0,"Weak sauce. True humor can only come from the depths. There must be something of far deeper meaning reflected to make anything of value and humor. The greatest humor is dark. And there is none of that here. There is not even any viable regular humor. It's all played for laughs rather than for truth and depth. There is nothing and no one to hold on to. The worst thing to do with any story, is to have no one to care for. I don't even need to fully relate to a character as long as I care about them and what happens to them. And there is nothing and no one here to care for. It is all surface schlock. There is no depth or meaning or purpose. It is all clownish caricature. I did not care for one single character. Each one was more selfish and surface than the last. I did not even care for Mickey 17. Bong Joon Ho has never impressed me with a single film he's made. They are all surface materials and have no depth of character or meaning. Everyone praises Snowpiercer as something grand and it was just as bland and shallow as this. I only give two stars for the visuals. However, visuals alone do not make a movie. Even then these visuals are not that great. I should give this film one star, but it is not the actors fault when the script is this bad and the director is this mediocre."
2025-05-25,2.0,Don't waste your time.
2025-05-25,9.0,"A different experience, the way the film progresses and develops the characters is captivating and particularly caught my attention, the whole concept is well developed even with his escapades to explain impossibilities, he does very well in all aspects, and integrates the comedy very well."
2025-05-25,10.0,"Amei o filme, fiquei presa nele, mas assistir no conforto de casa foi a melhor opção. :)"
2025-05-25,1.0,Horrible. Not sure what others who ranked it high saw that I didn’t.
2025-05-25,2.0,To dark and weird for me.  Definitely not funny unless you are warped.
2025-05-25,9.0,"Fantastic, hysterical, and incredibly relevant political satire set on the backdrop of wonderful science fiction set pieces."
2025-05-25,5.0,"Interesting and thought provoking, but plagued with dreariness. Something about these futuristic dystopian movies always have to be greay and grimey…why? Who wants to spend 2 hours in grey and grime? Blade runner, same thing. It also has a touch of Terry Gilliam- exhaustingly whimsical, which can make this a chore of a watch at times."
2025-05-25,4.0,"So different from the book (Mickey 7).
I did not like this.
Why so different?  Probably better if I hadn't read the book."
2025-05-25,6.0,"It's a good movie but i expected that it'll be better, 'cause directed it the parasites director, but huhh, better watch other movies"
2025-05-25,10.0,Another spectacular film by Boon Jo great and fabulous cast. Robert Pattinson amazing..👍👍
2025-05-24,10.0,"cara é muito bom, eu nao sei expressar o quanto eu gostei desse filme. achei incrivil a atuação do robert, como ele conseguiu interpretar cada personalidade muito bem. 

aiii aqueles bichinhos era mt fofos 😢😢😢"
2025-05-24,3.0,"Visually polished but narratively hollow.
Mickey 17 starts strong but collapses under the weight of its own premise. The second half abandons logic and emotional realism, with characters accepting absurd developments without question. What should’ve been a profound sci-fi exploration becomes a rushed, incoherent mess. Disappointing from both the director and the studio."
2025-05-24,4.0,"Um filme com uma ideia ótima, porém mal executada!
Pelo trailer os telespectadores acreditam ser algo mais ligado a ação com ficção científica, mas o filme é apelativo e traz uma sátira forçada!"
2025-05-24,8.0,"Mickey 17 might not be the sci fi film for everyone but it still delivers an entertaining time, while also having a lot to say. This movie is the latest project from legendary director Boon Joon Ho staring Robert Pattinson. The film dogs deep in a future society that we live in which is not very far off on how our current society is going. The quick premise is a disposable employee is sent on a human expedition to colonize the ice world Niflheim. After one iteration dies, a new body is regenerated with most of his memories intact. This sets up a very interesting premise but it could have still been so much more. Mark Ruffalo who plays the disgraced congressman who is leading the expedition here seems to really enjoy playing this part, as he plays it so well. I do wish the film would have been under 2 hours because it did seem to go on longer then it should have. Overall Mickey 17 gets a high 4 stars out of 5."
2025-05-24,5.0,"I’m usually a fan of Bong Joon Ho (the director), but this movie missed the mark. The CGI/effects were fantastic, but somewhere in the middle of the movie, the storyline was muddled & lost its way. Unfortunately, it went downhill from there. 

Mark Ruffalo usually does a top tier job with his roles, but it felt “off” & he didn’t do a good job with his portrayal. The other actors were fantastic though!"
2025-05-24,1.0,TRASH. Awful. horrible. dont waste your precious life.
2025-05-24,2.0,"Pattinson was solid. Ruffalo was flat out horrendous and ridiculously over the top. Could have been good but the director was so intent on lampooning a certain President, he ruined his movie. Couldn’t we just get an original villain? This was completed pre-election so I guess he took a gamble with the “two time loser” angle… oops. Well, at least he has Parasite, which was great."
2025-05-24,10.0,It’s such a shame that this film hadn’t gotten the views  it deserved. It’s a great film.
2025-05-24,1.0,"Terrible script, story and acting. I wish that I hadn't watched it."
2025-05-24,5.0,"An entertaining movie, actors seemed to enjoy making it however Mark Ruffalo’s thinly veiled attempt to mimic Trump made what was supposed to be fun entertainment, just another Hollywood lecture."
2025-05-23,5.0,"It had a promising start but then just rambles on and on. I get that it's intentional, but Mark Ruffalo is insufferable. The best part was the creatures."
2025-05-23,10.0,"Mickey 17 is a film like few others today. I love the way it portrays our bleak reality and how lost our humanity has become. The movie brilliantly illustrates how humans can be unbelievably foolish and despicable, treating lives with utter disregard. The lack of transparency in our reality is reflected throughout this film.

Ultimately, I find it to be an incredible movie. Robert Pattinson's performance is outstanding, and I also want to highlight the remarkable direction by Bong Joon Ho—his work in this film has been excellent, especially in the way he opens our eyes with this masterpiece"
2025-05-23,8.0,"Not as good as Parasite or Memories of Murder, but as good as Snowpiercer.

bassically, it's ""Hollywood"" Bong-Joon Ho"
2025-05-23,4.0,Good concept but does not deliver.
2025-05-23,10.0,"This movie is fun. Most of the criticism I see is for things that did happen, but didn't bother me. Is it long? Yes, it's a movie to savor, not one to squeeze in between other tasks. Does it love the creature design too much? Yes, because it's a cool design. See this movie. Give it time to immerse you. The romance is fun, the social commentary lands, the performances are STELLAR, especially Pattinson and Ackie, and it's an all around fun movie. Don't ask it to be something it's not and you'll have a fantastic time."
2025-05-22,1.0,Película terrible. El ritmo irregular y a veces lentísimo te rompe la narrativa. Las interpretaciones de Mark ruffalo y de Toni collete son histriónicas y sobreactuadas. Si has leído el libro aún te parecerá peor película por las malisimas decisiones en los cambios. Película totalmente prescindible.
2025-05-22,10.0,"What an incredible satire, it deals with issues of bioethics, survival, politics, collective thinking in a society governed by absolutism and totalitarianism, the awakening of individuals who begin to question the system, human narcissism and their lack of empathy with other living beings out of sheer ignorance. I think people who criticize it didn't have time to reflect and saw it in a very literal way, it's sad because I think it's a great work with a lot of background. 10/10"

2025-05-22,8.0,"Its a fascinating movie but it has a fundamental flaw. Mickey's memory is downloaded to the brick once every week through hard cable. It is to be noted that there is no wireless tech for that. Everytime he dies his new body is uploaded memories from the brick. So, he wouldn't have the memories of the death of his previous version. His concousness wouldn't continue, he would die. Consecutive mickey would just be a past copy. Another thing is with the advancement of telescopic tech humans from earth already know that the surface conditions of the alien planet. Why would they try to colonize the cold desert of a planet where crop ploduction would be impossible?"
2025-05-21,10.0,"Very strong plot with a fresh take on the sci-fi genre. The commentary and the cast are strong, which creates a very entertaining movie with a lot to say. NOT SIMILAR TO PARASITE, and that's okay! I enjoyed this movie thoroughly, and I loved seeing Bong Joon Ho expand into comedy. Pattinson's voice is a little silly, but it is a part of his character. Do yourself a favor and watch this film."
2025-05-20,5.0,"Interesting concept. However, it started strong and I started to lose interest"
2025-05-19,6.0,"One small step for man, one small step for man, one small step for man."
2025-05-19,5.0,It's hard to describe this one. Alien but a comedy? I'd say my most meh of 2025
2025-05-18,10.0,"Honestly I had so much fun watching this. The book it's based on is hardly Isaac Asimov. I honestly think it tidied up a few things and fleshed out a few characters. Mickey 17 is more sympathetic than Mickey 7, and the films depictions of female characters are again, way more fleshed out and interesting. It's chaotic and hilarious. Give it a go."
2025-05-18,4.0,"Robert Pattinson wasn't bad in this movie. At one point, he's playing alter egos which can be hard to pull off. His main character (Mickey 17) wasn't the ballsy type that we were expecting in the beginning (knowing that he chose the bravest job on the ship). He played a timid and gentle soul - which we're not use to seeing. His acting was believable. The humor wasn't there. If anything, you're laughing because most of the scenes and characters were bad. I couldn't finish the last 49 mins of the movie. I wish they chose a different cast for this movie. I think it would have elevated it a lot more."
2025-05-17,8.0,"I am not sure why this movie bombed as badly as it did. I watched it last night and it was thorougly enjoyable. It poses the existential questions about life, death and does it all have meaning if you can be ""reconstructed"" and have your most recent memories restored. Pattinson is great, but Mark Ruffalo provides most of the comic relief as a wannabe dictator. Go watch it. Cheers."
2025-05-16,10.0,Felt original with a lot of interesting ideas. great cast. Great for sci-fi fans.
2025-05-16,6.0,"Bong Joon Ho is back to the big screen with what should feel like a love letter to his sci-fi fans, the movie, however feels like something a Bong Joon Ho's copycat will make.

While 'MICKEY 17' wasn't a bad watch, it still had it's bumps, although, this movie was steady and quite engaging to an extent, it was not enough to make it an amazing cinematic experience. The movie started out well, but felt too dragged to be enjoyed.

This movie, however, was pulled out of it's icy rubbles by Robert Pattinson's power-house dual performance proving once more that you cannot get enough of Pattinson. Naomi Ackie also made up for the length by giving us one of her best performance yet. The ensemble was great.

Bong Joon Ho also directed this movie to a solid ground but it just wasn't enough to keep this movie on air.

Bong Joon Ho's 'MICKEY 17' was a decent watch, but it didn't quite feel like the Bong Joon Ho movie we are used to which at the end caused this movie to give a mid cinematic experience!"
2025-05-15,7.0,"Love how different this movie is. The tone is a little all over the place, but it is very entertaining and I would highly recommend."
2025-05-15,8.0,"A fun sci-fi tale with a pleasantly positive ending. Mark Ruffalo and Robert Pattinson are incredible, with Pattinson doing such a good job that he was almost unrecognizable."
2025-05-15,7.0,Wasn’t bad. Pleasantly surprised with how well done it was. Worse part of the movie is definitely Mark Ruffalo. He was the wrong casting choice for the role he had
2025-05-15,10.0,"Another hard-hitting tough one from the great director, however very rewarding to the end."
2025-05-14,6.0,"Started off promising, quirky, satirical. Really showcases Robert Pattinsons acting range! Then it got a bit long... bit too weird. Overly convoluted and wanted it to end."
2025-05-14,9.0,"Wonderful! A Stella cast al on top form, an interesting and different story, and of course directed by a master!"
2025-05-14,3.0,"Starts promising, then falls further into boringness and becomes incredibly drawn out. Not at all great."
2025-05-14,2.0,"Complete garbage!  This movie was the most boring, illogical mess I think I’ve ever seen.  Nonsense"
2025-05-13,2.0,Was trying to watch a movie not a ham fisted political commentary. This is why the left will continue to loose.
2025-05-11,5.0,Robert Patterson did an amazing job. I read the book And I know not to judge movies by the book.  I really like the book but this movie Did not do it for me. Like others have mentioned the second half drags. I knew it would be weird but they really left out a lot of the stuff that made the book interesting. Definitely disappointing for me.
2025-05-11,7.0,"Though slow to start and lacking a truly impactful climax, Mickey 17 may not represent Bong Joon-ho at his finest, but as a piece of conceptual sci-fi, it still manages to offer fresh and thought-provoking ideas to a genre in need of them."
2025-05-10,10.0,This is such a different movie/concept “expendable”. Good cast. Robert Pattinson is so versatile.
2025-05-09,2.0,The truth is this movie sucked!!!!! It should’ve went straight to TVs like they do with the Hallmark movies. I’ll just put it to you. This way. Sharknado is way more better than this.
2025-05-09,4.0,"This movie might have performed well with a PG-13 rating as none of what made it R-rated was necessary anyways. Also, it’s good but not great."
2025-05-08,8.0,"Vale la pena ver, y cuestionarse cosas que no solemos preguntarnos, pero que son una realidad actual."
2025-05-07,3.0,slow and boring. Any message gets lost in the slowness.
2025-05-07,5.0,"I'm not sure what this was.  Pattinson was good, but this movie was just bizarre and not really all that interesting.  I'm not sure why this was even made into a movie or why some of these top actors would take this project on.  Not great.  Not worth paying for.  Once this is free on one of the services, that would be the time to give it a look."
2025-05-06,8.0,"I liked the idea of the expendable clones but in the middle of the film it turned into a knock off of nausicca in the valley of the wind. The whole second half of this movie was just like that anime movies ending, almost exactly the same 👎 I’m just tired of watching remakes or derivative garbage."
2025-05-06,8.0,A little longer than it needed to be but it was fun and R.P. was excellent as always.
2025-05-05,9.0,"Mickey 17 é uma obra de ficção científica maravilhosa.

Tirando alguns clichês inevitáveis do gênero, o filme me pegou de jeito. A estética é impecável, o CGI é lindíssimo, e a crítica social por trás da história é GRITANTE — como já era de se esperar do Bong Joon-ho, que desde Parasita vem colocando o dedo na ferida.

O filme fala sobre um trabalhador CLONADO que é explorado e descartado como se fosse peça de reposição. Tem imperialismo, alienação, exploração da classe trabalhadora, e uma colonização planetária que funciona como metáfora direta de dominação e apagamento de culturas. Tudo isso embalado por uma ficção científica de altíssimo nível.

Robert Pattinson está ABSURDO. Atua com profundidade interpretando duas versões do Mickey, com personalidades diferentes, e a cena em que ele contracena com ele mesmo é nível altíssimo. É de longe uma das melhores atuações da carreira dele, e uma baita virada de página pra quem um dia foi zoado por Crepúsculo.

Naomi Ackie (Nasha) me surpreendeu muito. Não tava esperando tanto, e ela entregou com emoção e presença.

Steven Yeun (Timo) fez ali o café com leite daquele amigo babaca, mas também entregou um bom papel.

E a Ilpha, interpretada pela Toni Collette, merece destaque. Desde Hereditário, ela já mostrou que sabe entregar tudo — e aqui ela transita entre o cômico, o estranho e o dramático com naturalidade. Tem uma cena, sem dar spoiler, que dá até um calafrio ver ela atuando, especialmente quando o tom dela lembra o que ela fez em Hereditário. Foi só uma cena ou outra, coisa de poucos minutos, mas muito boa.

Mark Ruffalo faz aquele papel mais teatral, meio paspalhão, lembrando uma caricatura de líder americano tipo “Make America Great Again”. Parece que foi proposital, talvez até pedido do diretor.

No fim, Mickey 17 é tudo: crítica social, espetáculo visual, ficção científica de respeito.
Não é um filme pra todo mundo — mas eu tô feliz de não ser todo mundo.
Bong Joon-ho segue sendo GIGANTE.

🇺🇸 English Version
Mickey 17 is a beautiful piece of science fiction.

Besides some expected genre clichés, the movie really pulled me in. The visuals are stunning, the CGI looks great, and the social commentary is LOUD — which is exactly what you'd expect from Bong Joon-ho after Parasite.

The plot follows a CLONED worker, created to be exploited and discarded like a tool. There’s imperialism, alienation, class exploitation, and planetary colonization used as a metaphor for domination and cultural erasure. All of it wrapped in high-level sci-fi.

Robert Pattinson is amazing. He brings depth to two different versions of Mickey, and the scene where he plays against himself is just incredible. Honestly, it’s one of the best performances of his career — a solid comeback after all the Twilight mockery.

Naomi Ackie (Nasha) really surprised me. I wasn’t expecting much, but she delivered with emotion and presence.

Steven Yeun (Timo) plays that kind of annoying friend character, but he also did a solid job.

And then there's Ilpha, played by Toni Collette, who deserves a proper shout-out. Since Hereditary, she’s shown she can do it all — and here she shifts between comedy, weirdness, and drama so naturally. There’s one scene — no spoilers — where she speaks in a tone that’s very reminiscent of Hereditary, and it gave me chills. Just a short moment, but really effective.

Mark Ruffalo plays a theatrical, over-the-top character — kind of a caricature of a “Make America Great Again” leader. It feels intentional, maybe even director-driven.

In the end, Mickey 17 brings it all: sharp social critique, amazing visuals, and strong sci-fi.
It’s not a movie for everyone — and I’m glad I’m not everyone.
Bong Joon-ho is still a powerhouse."

2025-05-05,8.0,"Mickey 17 is an obscurely funny movie. I say that because even though I actually enjoyed watching this movie. Mickey 17 is very weird. I had very high hopes for this movie based on it being Robert Pattinson’s next big project. But especially after seeing a trailer in theaters, it looked like it had the potential to be a classic. But I mean you could say that about almost any movie nowadays, even though in most cases it never pans out in the end.

2025-05-05,1.0,"Was pretty excited for this movie but it was unwatchable, couldn't finish it. Got real boring real fast, some plot points didn't make sense, and the over-the-top Trump impersonation from Mark Ruffalo felt so shoehorned in and cringe. Good cinematography though I guess."
2025-05-05,9.0,"It had a Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy satire vibe, but much darker. Quite original dystopia and I love dystopian, but I can definitely see why it wouldn't be everybody's cup of tea."
2025-05-05,7.0,"The character development is good, but the movie needs a sequel."
2025-05-05,3.0,The whole movie is a waste of time.  None of the characters are relatable.  I didn't care about any of it.  Save your time.  Watch something else.
2025-05-04,3.0,"I saw this as a double feature with Minecraft, and somehow, Minecraft had less cringe than this movie."
2025-05-04,9.0,"Loved the dark humor, loved the originality, overall it was a very fun watch."
2025-05-03,3.0,Horrible. This movie was the slowest way to nowhere ever.  Mark Ruffalo was a waste of money and time.  Such a horrible job.  The whole thing is a 2 hr cringe fest that isnt funny or creative.  Its completly ruined by trying so hard to be weird.
2025-05-03,3.0,"This is essentially a bottom tier SNL 'Let's make fun of Trump' sketch stretched out into a full length movie.

I couldn't actually tell you how long it was because it was getting so tiresome I switched it off sometime in the 3rd act. 

It's a shame because the premise was interesting; the lead role was played perfectly. 

This isn't a case of left vs right, if there's a politician to be made fun of, I'm all for it. However this was executed with such low effort and writing craft I couldn't reward it with any more of my time. 

If I wanted a mediocre rehash of why all the cool kids hate Trump I'd just go to the in laws for dinner, at least they'd wash the dishes. I mean seriously, this movie goes to enormous lengths to make the Trump character *so* much like the real Donald. However they shy away from a 1:1 impression so you're left with this uncanny valley Trump, its really quite unnerving to watch. They should have just deepfaked it and maybe then it would be funny or even memorable. 

Probably not"
2025-05-02,4.0,"I usually love scifi, even bad scifi. This was only so-so. My reasons ... odd creative decisions. It felt like someone who hated scifi made this as a joke/political fantasy. There were some good points, but there were also lots of bad points.  It could of really been a good movie, but it was not."
2025-05-02,9.0,Fun scifi movie with good acting and script.
2025-05-02,8.0,It was a good movie to watch on ailen invasion. Sci-fi. It was definitely a recommended to watch if ailen and creepers creatures and other ailen stuff. The content was nice and cgi is good! The cast were good.
2025-05-02,8.0,"I'm a huge fan of Bong Joon Ho.  This movie was fun but I felt it was trying to hit too many themes, which left it not nailing any of them.  The set pieces will make it a great movie to have on in the background while cleaning the house."
2025-05-02,9.0,"It's imperfect, but we should keep giving Bong Joon Ho money to make more"
2025-05-02,8.0,"Mickey 17 is a visually glorious and surprisingly romantic film that caught me totally off guard. It nails the sci-fi aesthetics and the look of the movie really helped sell the premise for me. Its not revolutionary or wildly innovative but the story is interesting and grounded in deeply human themes. Robert Pattinson gives an amazing performance (once you get past the slightly goofy character voice) and effortlessly carries the emotional and existential weight of the film with impressive charm.

The first act is by far the strongest: compelling, mysterious, and tightly paced. It sets up a fascinating world and a main character that had me fully engaged. But it does seem to fumble around as the movie goes on... especially in the final act. While I really like Mark Ruffalo and I think he brings his all to this role, his character (along with a few others) lacks subtlety and depth in a way that I felt cheapened the story. Nevertheless, the journey is engaging and rewarding... especially any time Naomi Ackle and Anamaria Vartolomei are onscreen.

Overall, it's a fun and engaging watch with a surprisingly romantic core. I'd easily recommend."
2025-05-01,10.0,"Eu amei o filme,nele eu ""vi"" algumas ""referências"" q eu queria MT ressaltar pois achei geniais,quando o Marshall levanta o dedo indicador parece muito a saudação nazista,refletindo a influência q uma pessoa pode ter sobre as outras sem ter responsabilidade o suficiente,ainda mais uma pessoa famosa q não tem nenhuma qualificação para exercer um papel tão importante,mesmo sem querer,além disso quando a nasha fala dos nativos parece(na minha visão) uma referência as invasões de terras invocadas,como quando os europeus chegaram à América"
2025-05-01,7.0,I have not watched the movie yet but it looks like it has potential.
2025-05-01,7.0,"Great acting, interesting story just wish the final act was a bit more booming"
2025-04-30,7.0,"I had fun watching this film. It was a little bit weird, but creative and different enough to be enjoyable. In an era where originality is lacking in entertainment, this was a welcomed breath of fresh air.
It touches on a few important ethical subjects, while also managing to be funny, in a dark humour type way. 

It's not without it's flaws tho. I think the first half of the movie is better than the last. It was more interesting and intriguing. It's not a major flaw tho. The movie still remains solid in the latter half. It's just that it seems like 2 movies were glued together. Bong Joon-Ho's ""Parasite"" also had that aspect of 2 different stories merging near the end, but it worked great there. Here it wasn't as effective.
The other flaw, and the biggest one, was Mark Ruffalo's acting. He seemed to be doing a Trump impression (a pretty bad one, since he is such a bad actor), mixed with some other personality, which made the scenes he was in extremely annoying. Everytime he showed up, it made me want to press the forward button. That's how annoying it was.

I heard people complain about this movie and saying they were expecting more coming from Bong Joon-Ho; specially after ""Parasite"". But i think that is not fair for him. ""Parasite"" is one of those rare movies, that only gets made every few years. It's not realistic, nor fair, to expect every movie a director/writer releases, to be as good a masterpiece like ""Parasite"".
I cannot wait to watch his next work."
2025-04-30,1.0,not a very good watch. childish. would maybe rip it and not pay for this
2025-04-30,8.0,"Thoroughly enjoyable and very clever - excellent cinematography, too. Well worth watching."
2025-04-30,6.0,"An original story with good acting. Mark Ruffalo, Robert Pattinson, and Steven Yeun really carried the movie. Naomi Ackie and Toni Collete were just terrible and they ruined the movie for me. Everything else was fine."
2025-04-30,1.0,"Way too long/boring, infinitely juvenile, not funny, not cute, not anything. Some of the worst dialogue in history. There is no such thing as the worst movie ever made. However, there is a land where lots of movies are in an eternal tie with ALL the other worst movies ever made, where this movie resides. Parasite is great, but Bong Joon Ho proves, like Jordan Peele, he can make absolute stinkers as well."
2025-04-30,4.0,"I wanted to like this movie. I get this movie was intentionally over the top, but the obvious political messaging really broke the immersion. Ruffalo is such a talented actor and it seemed he was off his game when doing an impersonation of the president. It came off as forced and out of place in a setting when forced and out of place was the theme.

I do not care what side of the political isle the message lines up with, I watch movies to get a fanciful break from reality. When I get movie makers political alignments shoved in my face I cannot stay with the fantasy of the movie. It is like Frodo pulling out a cell phone and ordering door dash."
2025-04-30,9.0,If this doesn’t prove Robert Pattinson as a top tier actor then simply put you don’t understand talent. His days of Edward Cullen are long behind him and he nails every role he plays
2025-04-29,6.0,"A quirky, interesting satire and social critique with enough to watch to the end but maybe could have delivered more with the team and budget.  Ruffalo and Collette's roles are comically over the top as is much of the film."
2025-04-29,8.0,"Good story, the ending is ok but not very interesting"
2025-04-29,6.0,"I get what they're going for, but it was just... kinda boring."
2025-04-29,8.0,Very good sarcastic movie. Robert slay as always
2025-04-29,8.0,"Interesante, entretenida. 
Tiene el humor y la crítica socio política que caracteriza al director, pero con una propuesta muy distinta a lo que esperaba ver. 
Lamentablemente encuentro que falla en ciertos elementos que son olvidados o dejados de lado, junto con eso, un final demasiado blanco en vez de los tintes más grises que pudo tener. 
Aún así es una película divertida y atrapante.
Me hizo querer adentrarme en el psi-fi"
2025-04-28,6.0,Super creative. Worth seeing if you like experimental sci fi.
2025-04-28,1.0,"Waste of time. 
Every character was lame, and I could predict the movie in less than20 minuets. Very predictable and forgettable film. 
Mark Ruffalo should be ashamed of himself, and I can only hope that Robert Pattinson made good use of the paycheck he received from this movie."
2025-04-28,10.0,Thought provoking film and amazing range and acting from Robert Pattinson!  Loved every minute of his lovable characters.  Mark Ruffalo also knocked it out of the park playing his over-the-top character perfectly.
2025-04-28,8.0,survivor of the new era
2025-04-28,8.0,"Actually really entertaining, interesting concept, well executed, great acting especially Pattison playing the multiple versions of himselves with different characteristics.

Some really over the top characters (Ruffalo/Collette).

Worth a watch for sc-fi fans."
2025-04-28,8.0,This is worth a watch. Original story so I was hooked already. Just entertaining enough to keep me locked in till the end. Robert Pattinson is a phenomenal actor 👏
2025-04-28,1.0,Fairytale children's version Nausicaa. Very shitty movie
2025-04-28,7.0,"I was rather impressed with Robert's acting. Liked the storyline but definitely could have been 30 mims shorter. 

Great acting all around. Worth a re-watch."
2025-04-28,8.0,"First time seeing Bong Joon Ho movie. Mickey 17 is a great movie to watch. First time hearing Robert Pattison natural voice with his accent. Throughout the movie his acting seem natural. He seem to dive into character easily and enjoy every scene. His chemistry with his other self really show the human bond can be created in short time. It is sad to see things have to be let go, but in the end the sacrifice was worth. Definitely a must watch if you are a fan of the director or Pattison!"
2025-04-27,7.0,"Mickey 17 feels more spiritually connected to Bong Joon Ho's genre-bending works like The Host and Snowpiercer than to his Oscar-winning Parasite. While undeniably flawed and occasionally heavy-handed with its political satire, the film offers something fresh and exciting in the sci-fi landscape.

The real standout is Robert Pattinson's remarkable performance as Mickey and his various clones. Each iteration feels distinctly different - a testament to Pattinson's range and commitment. When another Mickey appears on screen, you genuinely feel like you're watching a different person, despite the shared face. This virtuoso performance elevates the material considerably.

As with many of Bong's English-language films, some of his trademark dark comedy doesn't quite translate with the same razor-sharp edge we've come to expect from his Korean productions. The nuanced absurdism that made The Host so memorable feels somewhat diluted here, perhaps lost in translation or cultural context.

Still, there's an undeniable originality to Mickey 17 that keeps you engaged. The film's exploration of expendability and corporate exploitation resonates, even when the execution falters. It's imperfect sci-fi that's more forgiving in its genre, buoyed by creative world-building and Pattinson's multi-faceted turn.

For those willing to embrace its flaws, Mickey 17 offers an intriguing addition to Bong's diverse filmography.​​​​​​​​"
2025-04-27,1.0,"Alas, this was flat out boring."
2025-04-27,3.0,Any humanity and gravity that were present in the (super fun) book has been ground out by slapstick and wackiness that doesn't click and somehow manages to brashly steamroll the cool ideas into inconsequence. Some great acting in a steaming mess.
2025-04-27,7.0,"Very cool Dystopian Sci-fi. I loved the creativity. It lacks a bit, not a classic, but damn it was neat."
2025-04-27,10.0,Thought provoking and quite fun .
2025-04-26,5.0,The acting is good and you can almost witness how hard they are trying to deliver as actors with a storyline that falls short. The cast sea of the story is great. Could have been better
2025-04-26,8.0,"A unique film that leaves the viewer entertained. Playful and doesn't take itself to serious, this film defines what I love about cinema, creating a space in time to let your mind wander with the fun ideas. Creatively inspirational."
2025-04-26,4.0,This was a pointless movie. The acting was good. It just seemed to take forever to get to the end.
2025-04-26,9.0,Pattinson surprised me with his range and I almost didn't recognize him because the character had a very useful appearance.  That being said It was consistently dark and goofy at the same time and very much watchable.
2025-04-26,10.0,One of the best movie of 2025 so far bong joon jo and Ryan coogler are highlights this year for movies waiting for the valley now must watch.
2025-04-26,7.0,"I enjoy Robert Pattison performance but Rufffalo was awful, I wouldn't watch again."
2025-04-26,1.0,Just a complete waste of time. No imagination. Watching the real Trump in action is much more entertaining.
2025-04-26,8.0,A fun and enjoyable sci fi with a goofy villian.
2025-04-25,5.0,"Started off so original and stylish, descended into the extreme. The last half wreaked of writers/directors going more for shock n' awe than a cohesive plot and gripping story"
2025-04-24,8.0,"I feel like this movie would've been better as two movies, fleshing out Mickeys love and the power struggle at the end."
2025-04-24,7.0,A fun sci-fi comedy with a familiar villain

2025-04-23,2.0,Everything wrong with hollywood.
2025-04-23,6.0,"This movie wavers between ridiculous and trying to make a statement. It fails at both, but it is still pretty okay."
2025-04-23,10.0,"This is a movie about narcissistic leaders who are full of bluster and self-importance, who resist scientific opinion, who act without concern for their natural environment or animal inhabitants, and who reduce the culture to the lowest possible denominator.  It is a very difficult film to watch, as all critics admit, but not for the technical reasons they give, but because this film is an unexaggerated portrait of none other than ourselves."
2025-04-23,2.0,"It wasn't funny, simply mocking. There was no witty dialogue,  interesting moments or even anything slightly original."
2025-04-22,10.0,"This movie was great. Absolutely comedy gold. Cool story bro. Haters gonna hate. 
Mark Ruffalo, Robert Pattinson, and Steven Yeun are incredible."
2025-04-22,5.0,It was interesting at times but I had a hard time following because I wasn't paying much attention. Best thing about it was Mark Ruffalo but it was still too long and mostly boring.
2025-04-22,2.0,"Terrible, but in a fascinating way."
2025-04-22,3.0,"Pattinson carried this film. Ruffalo was beyond ""cartoonish"" villain and was painful to watch on screen. Plot went off the rails. Subplots either didn't get resolved or were half baked or just came out of nowhere. Ending was just bad. Also seemed to be weird political correlations to modern day USA with some of the acting and dialogue that felt super forced and on the nose. Quite bad."
2025-04-22,1.0,such a waste of talent. movie is not good and i wish i didnt watch it all the way through
2025-04-21,1.0,"not good, actors were ok but plot and storyline not good"
2025-04-21,2.0,Why did I waste my time!  I’ll never get that time back.
2025-04-21,1.0,Pattinson now in every thing but anyways with a different actor I would give 2 Stars still not realy good
2025-04-21,3.0,"Starts strong, ends boringly.  This was a waste of time and money. Seriously, concept seems good- human cloning, expendable person used for scientific answers on disease, tradition, and more.  But then goes horribly off the rails making fun of Trump and religion/cults. Sigh, pointless dribble by the end.  Don't waste your time."
2025-04-21,8.0,Interesting but wouldn't watch again
2025-04-21,8.0,"Mark Ruffalo was channeling the spirit of Trump — a very, very annoying version of Trump, which took you out of the film. Steven Yeun was great, and so was Robert Pattinson. I feel like the film’s ending was left on the cutting room floor — maybe it was too dark for audience."
2025-04-20,3.0,"Started so strong, lost its steam. It’s nothing more than an idea. Nothing compelling at all to tie it all together. No interesting commentary about anything and it just drags on and on and on. What a miss from my favourite director"
2025-04-20,2.0,"Started off great and I thought I knew where this is going, dumb guy comes good but no, it becomes a physiological doo dah. The story of two same guys..the dilemma of a girl sharing identical blokes but with two personalities, it became uninteresting. The budget was spent on the beginning and a little bit at the end, the rest is a 1½hr play, and if you chopped that off it would make a great 30 minute short film. Therefore it is too long filled in with uninteresting claptrap, a bit like this review. So much potential yet poorly executed."
2025-04-20,6.0,"“When a director is given too much power” that is the lesson that Mickey 17 teaches us. Mickey 17 is one of the first big-budget movies to come out in 2025. Directed by Bong Joon Ho, the same person who directed the cinematic masterpieces such as Parasite, the movie came out with high hopes from both critics and audiences alike. Unfortunately, the movie was not able to come close to the hype it had garnered.

Summary
Mickey 17 follows the story of Mickey. A man who volunteers to become a test subject on a space mission to escape the people who are chasing him on earth. In the movie’s universe, humanity has discovered how to clone people and uses ‘expendables’ (people that have the sole purpose of dying for scientific inquiry) to conduct experiments on the human body. Once the person dies, they can be cloned again, loaded with their past memories and used for future experiments. This goes wrong when the 17th version of Mickey is presumed to be dead and his 18th version is cloned. The movie then follows Mickey 17th as he returns to the ship and finds his place taken by his clone, Mickey 18th.

World Building
The movie does a good job of worldbuilding. A common mistakes that sci-fi movies make is to rely on exposition (people talking about the world around them) for worldbuilding instead of actually showing the world and its rules. Mickey 17 balances these 2 aspects well. From the start, we hear Mickey 17 as a inner monologue and are shown the things he talks about. This helps the audience understand the world without making it feel complicated. The problem happens, when you are an hour into the movie and Mickey is still monologueing. Representing a detailed description of the world and its rules is not necessarily a bad thing, done well, it can help the audience’s immersion. But when it takes an hour to explain the world and nothing important happens in the story other than Mickey 18th being formed (Which the audience already know about from the trailers), the audience tend to loose their attention and that point, no amount of fancy visuals can bring their attention back.

WHAT, WHEN, WHY
Every good movie needs to establish its What — what the main character hopes to accomplish; its When — the time by which they must achieve it; and its Why — the reason it matters. Without establishing these, a movie ends up being disfocused and lost in its plot. If the audience do not have a clear goal that needs to be achieved then everything ends up feeling pointless. This is the biggest mistake that Mickey 17 makes. From start to end, not once does the movie establish a clear goal that the characters need to achieve and a time frame for them to achieve it. There are some implicit goals and this can work, if, there is only one implicit goal and it is not interfered with. A movie cannot have multiple, unclear, implicit goals that are competing with one another. First, Mickey 17th has the implicit goal of following Mickey 18th. Why must he follow him? Because it’s a clone and he should. But then they meet and the goal ends. Now what, now they want to kill the head of the ship. Why? Because the captain treats them like expendables, but then everyone on the ship treats them like that, so they should logically kill everyone. But then, they fail. Now, they must save humanity. Why are they the ones saving humanity? Because they are the main characters, but there is nothing special about them, they might be clones but they are still humans, that isn’t a special ability. Boo Joon Ho uses the entire movie to showcase this amazing and detailed world he has created, but he never gives the audience a clear goal that Mickey 17th needs to achieve in this world.

Setups and Payoffs
Every movie needs setups and payoffs. The movie setups the goals that need to be achieved and then works towards the final payoff. This concept isn’t just limited to goals, a movie can setup a certain metaphor or external element and then use it later (this becomes the payoff). Unfortunately, for Mickey 17, this setup and payoff element is not executed well. Every movie is made of 3 acts, it’s introduction, main part, conclusion. Mickey 17 loosely sets up metaphors and goals in it’s first act and then rushes to close them up in the third act. The second act adds nothing to the movie and then continues to conflict and ruin the one implicit goal the first act set up. If you ignore the second act of the movie, all of it’s confusion and contradiction then the movie ends up being quite focused. Because, at the end of the movie, the only goals that are achieved are those set up in the first act. The second act goals are just ignored and forgotten by the movie.

Too many themes
The movie tries to tackle a lot of themes. Where a good movie only needs to tackle one or at max 2 themes. Mickey 17 tries to take on 3 of them: Ethics and Morality, Church and State, Situations and the Poor. A movie like Mickey 17 could have easily stuck to the ethics of making new people with the same memories (Some complicated story building also shows that it is not even the exact same memories). The storybuilding is also used to tackle the poverty theme and how it forces people into unfavourable situations. But then the movie decided to add a third theme. How the church and religion influnce the decisions made by the state (the captain). This theme is then not tackled in any meaningful way. It is represented to show it exists and then nothing is done with it. So the third theme ends up complicating the message of the movie without showing any meaningful messages of its own.

Conclusion
In conclusion. The movie looks amazing, from it’s quality to the colour grading to the wardrobe choices. The acting in Mickey 17 is phenomenal. Robert Pattinson does an amazing job of bringing his character to life. But other than these, there are no pros to it. It is a disfocused mess with no meaning or goal to it. Even the character arc is a lousy and unjustified mess. If you love Robert Pattinson and his work then maybe give it a try, but for any reasons other than that, skip it."
2025-04-20,8.0,"First of all props to robert pattinson, he did amazing with his role on this film - he’s a very good actor. I really like how the film gives you life lessons throughout the movie, and how well balanced the genre’s are. A good amount of sci-fi and romance, To sum it up this film is worth watching."
2025-04-20,9.0,"I loved it! It’s weird and quirky, but also quite fun. A bit self-indulgent and over-the-top at times, but overall really refreshing. It felt like watching a live action anime, and Robert Pattinson was just incredible."
2025-04-20,8.0,A dynamic adventure movie with hints of comedy and drama.

2025-04-20,1.0,I was curious to see after watching the trailer. Looked good. Waste of time. Not the actors fault.
2025-04-20,4.0,"This felt too rushed in my opinion, almost focused too much on the satire that it forgot to do something more useful with the main story which was pretty weak. The satire I supposed is supposed to carry this film. Had high hopes for this maybe next time Mr Bong"
2025-04-20,6.0,A solid film through and through with an exceptional and eccentric performance from Robert Pattinson. I wish they had not essentially spoiled the entire film in the promotional trailers.
2025-04-20,5.0,I really wanted to like this movie from all the reviews but ended up walking out of the theater halfway.

2025-04-20,2.0,Terrible did not like it
2025-04-20,3.0,"Robert Pattinson's performance does a lot to save this movie, but the ""political message"" just doesn't land and it's clear it counted on a different political result. It's a gamble and it didn't pay off, movies used to mean something."
2025-04-19,2.0,"Without doubt the worst film I’ve ever seen - so bad I was determined to write a review. I have no idea what the ‘clever’ social commentary was about. The acting was awful, but I’m sure the script wasn’t helpful. Too long; not funny; not engaging and no storyline to speak of."
2025-04-19,9.0,"I loved this movie to about 95%: Great visuals, competent acting, engaging story and good message. I liked the mix of sci-fi, dystopian future and hopeful comment on humanity, without resorting to the usual cheap Hollywood action setpieces and inhuman killing sprees. The 5% I hated about the movie were Mark Ruffalo‘s and Toni Collette‘s badly overacted villains. Ruffalo tries to impersonate Trump, and fails badly. Their whole act just feels like a cheap shot at Trump, Republicans, and like an attempt to put christians in a bad light and get some laughs at their expense. It all fails badly and the movie would be perfect, if the villains had been as well written and acted as the rest of the characters. Instead we get some bad parodies by obviously hateful actors and/or writers. But overall a great movie."
2025-04-19,9.0,Para esto fue creado el septimo arte
2025-04-19,10.0,"From concept to execution, this movie is brilliant and Pattinson is everything here."
2025-04-19,6.0,"Quite left field and strange on the face of it but the over all story was good and the acting was great, Ruffallo steals the show, so it was a fairly enjoyable ride. Some of the sub plots were a bit too random to make sense and as an audience it felt like we were being asked to just go with until something else random happened to distract us."
2025-04-19,5.0,"Robert Parkinson's efforts aside, sadly this isn't very good. The on the nose social commentary combined with overacting masquerading as comedy is just cringeworthy and the whole thing smacks of wasted potential. Red hats? Honestly?"
2025-04-19,7.0,"It's a promising movie with a lot of good ideas and story ideas with possibilities on where to take them. Robert Pattinson does a stellar job fleshing out being a simple ying-yang/polar opposites duo performance. But, the holes or lack of significant character development or any emotional background to the character of Mickey without any further explanation as to what is happening, makes it all feel like a let down (especially that buzzkill, lackluster ending). The confliction only deepens more so since this is Bong Jong-Ho's follow-up from the masterpiece that is PARASITE. Otherall, not the worst for the year or as an Sci-Fi Comedy but will probably end up being Bong's worst like STOKER was for Chan Wook-Park."
2025-04-19,2.0,Walked out of the cinema it was so bad. Is this the world we are turning into that this rubbish is supposed to entertain us. I only wish 1 day we could give less than 1 star because giving this 1 star is doing it a favour.
2025-04-19,4.0,"Started off interesting as many modern films but started to unravel fairly quickly.  A weak plot, weak writing, and terrible charicature-type characters.  Generally a cynical view of humanity and the future.  Dystopian films should be a warning-off of our dangerous tendencies, but this one just seems borne of stupidity more than anything, and for that reason is mostly unbelievable.  THe plot could have been squeezed into an hour.  WHy it took 2.5 hours to develop this nothing burger, I do not know.  Robert Pattison was barely watchable along with many of the other actors who with better direction and script I am sure could have been much better."
2025-04-19,10.0,"Loved a new take on a possible dystopian future. Great movie with a total package of acting, directing, humor and screenplay from a book. I just wish I could've caught it in the theater so I could support more of this type of cinema, rather than the super hero/sequel genre."
2025-04-19,8.0,"Fun and engaging. Even though it sometimes misses the mark, I’d recommend anyone to watch it."
2025-04-19,10.0,"A very different creative, entertaining movie experience."
2025-04-18,8.0,"While it often dazzles - the moments in between lack a spark to keep you 100% clocked in. It's an incredible movie that somehow packs so much in, that momentum is lost between the world building scenes. It's still worth watching for its incredible performances, moving story and stirring action scenes. Come for the mob movie in space - and leave happy."
2025-04-18,8.0,"Weirdly strange and strangely weird … but … had to keep watching it. While Robert Pattinson was great, Mark Ruffolo and Toni Collette stole the show."
2025-04-18,10.0,"I Recommend this film. It Was Not Filmed In Camcorder Mode! Just for this reason, still a good movie."
2025-04-18,9.0,"Mickey 17 é um thriller de ficção científica, com um leve toque cômico que promete ter trazido às telas novamente a magia do cineasta Bong Joon-ho (diretor do fantástico filme Parasita). Desde já, vou deixar claro que adorei o filme, e que deu pra notar nele a ""assinatura"" de Bong Joon-ho. O filme apresenta um futuro distópico bem elaborado, e imerge o espectador nele através de imagens alucinantes (sem grandes exageros) e boa ambientação. Também cria toda a ""mitologia"" (digamos assim), que não é muito complexa, nem mesmo muito realista, porém, não vejo como um problema, pois o filme não se leva à sério, adotando um tom cômico, tanto através das situações da trama e de certas ""piadas"", como também pelo personagem principal Mickey 17 (principalmente por ele), que é muito bem interpretado por Robert Pattinson. Esse personagem (Mickey 17) talvez pode não agradar muitas pessoas pelo seu jeito excessivamente caricato, infantilizado e etc., mas consegue roubar nossa simpatia, e é apoiado pelo tom do filme. O filme apresenta muitas críticas e subtextos e até mesmo alegorias que enriquecem mais a obra: crítica social, política, religiosa (infelizmente para quem é religioso) e até sobre colonização e fascismo. As demais atuações estão perfeitas, e quero destacar Mark Ruffalo, como o Sr. Marshall, ele é perfeito: engraçado, ridículo, vilanesco, quase que implacável e babaca também [kkkk]. Mas o mais impressionante é a habilidade única de Bong Joon-ho (diretor) de extrair o máximo das situações da trama, gerando tensão, alucinação e prendendo o espectador até o fim, sempre explorando as relações humanas da forma mais ""roubada"" (no bom sentido) possível. Por fim, não chega a repetir a qualidade de Parasita, porém não por demérito, mas sim por mérito de Parasita. É um filmaço, mas depende da sua identificação com a obra. Recomendo. Nota 8,6 e 4,5 estrelas aqui."
2025-04-18,10.0,Loved it! Definitely did not expect the movie to go where it did but it was the best movie I've seen in a while. I laughed a lot more than I thought I would. Definitely goes with the theme of what we're living in right now lol
2025-04-18,10.0,i wish this movie got more appreciation! unbelievably cool movie with unique sci-fi elements. even has a good love story
2025-04-18,8.0,A very interesting and fresh plot! There may be a few plot holes or confusing aspects but overall a great film worth your time.
2025-04-18,4.0,"wasted potential, they create a good setting for a good IP, but i dont know where the direction is, not funny, not thrilling, very falt story after 20 minutes end up as enviromental mother nature campaign.. really a wasted potential"
2025-04-18,10.0,"Bong Joon-ho's latest film Mickey 17 is seen as a visually interesting and conceptually science fiction film with strong performance of Robert Pattinson's portrayal of the multiple iterations was widely praised, critics acknowledged Bong's unique vision, distinctive style, and his ability to blend genres, as well as world-building and cinematography often commended. The sharp satirical of capitalism, colonialism, and contemporary politicals was noted yet found heavy-handed unlike Mark Ruffalo's character drawing parallels. But despite it's box-office disappointment, the movie proves to have found  it's pacing, narrative, and thematic delivery to be less refined compared to Bong Joon-ho's previous successes."
2025-04-17,2.0,"So much love to make something so awful. The black comedy element is weak and unfunny, the moralistic theme undercooked. It would have been better had it been played as a straight up serious sci-fi or a full on spoof. Mark Ruffalo is normally a brilliant character actor but the cheese is dialled to 11 and is a real turn off, Robert Pattinson's fake childish articulation is also incredibly annoying. Genuinely cannot understand any of the positive reviews, the trailer also gives a very false impression. Avoid."
2025-04-17,10.0,"Saludos, yo soy Etienne, voy a hablar de mi película preferida «Mickey 17». El protagonista es Mickey y el número 17 se refiere a los otros 16 Mickeys que preceden Mickey 17. El realizador es Bong Joon Ho y es de Corea del Sud.La película es una película de ciencia ficción, también de acción  y de comedia. La película se desarrolla en el futuro donde es posible hacer réplicas de humanos y Mickey es una réplica. Mickey murió 16 veces por la ciencia. Asha es la compañera del protagonista y los dos tienen una relación muy particular e íntima. El antagonista Kenneth Marshall es un dictador y el comandante de la naveta espacial donde se desarrolla la mayoría de la película. Kenneth y también su mujer son personajes muy  infamosos que casi todos odian también yo. El comienzo de la película es muy interesante porque vemos cómo funciona la máquina que hace las réplicas y las experimentaciones científicas. Me encanta esta película porque los personajes son muy interesantes, quiero la ciencia ficción y provoca muchas emociones porque hay momentos tristes y chistes. Yo recomiendo este película porque es uniqua y muy interesante."
2025-04-17,10.0,"Incredible plot and writing , Dynamic performances from the cast . The underlying sub-text and self reflection of America was eye opening . Black mirror-esque Dystopia yet realistic near-future ."
2025-04-17,2.0,Difficult to sit through with all the IRL political undertones. Can we just make movies and tell great stories?
2025-04-17,7.0,Good Movie. But at times seems boring.
2025-04-17,2.0,"A cynical, ugly and uninsightful take on humans. I understand that some people might find this a breath of fresh air If they have spent the last decade watching Marvel Movies with sacarine heroes being absurdly virtuous, but for myself, the philosophical statement about humanity is empty and nasty. The movie fundamentally seemingly wants to be a clever statement about avarice, but ultimately ends up just being a mirror to the Directors own uncharitable views of people

characters aren't motivated by literally anything other than there own idiotic greed and spite. The suspension of disbelief never takes off, and you are, I suppose, merely meant to laugh as every single character tries to ruthlessly exploit each other. All in all, a high budget movie which presents hollow arbitrary meanness as something insightful. If I laughed more, I would have forgiven it as a psychopathic inversion of Star Trek. I didn't laugh. Oh look, everyone double crosses each other every 30 seconds. Yawn."
2025-04-17,7.0,"Sincere in its weirdness and strong in its satire, Mickey 17 offers viewers a new experience all around. From a unique and peculiar premise to Pattinson's crazy, over-the-top acting, Bong Joon Ho's sci-fi dark comedy is an entertaining watch that doesn't shy away from touching on a myriad of complex themes."
2025-04-17,9.0,robert pattinson acting is another level
2025-04-17,6.0,"Una película con una historia buena, pero demasiado lenta y aveces muy novelesco, llega a tener momentos muy aburridos, las actuaciones 10 de 10"
2025-04-17,4.0,Man I was disappointed.i thought this movie was going to be a great sci-fi film but it sucked. although there was some good action and premise it just couldn't follow through. At first I thought ok maybe if I just give it time but nope it did not get better and by the end I was bored out of my mind. So ya I wouldn't watch again and over all its a 2.3/10.
2025-04-17,10.0,"Creative. Original. Didn’t waste my time, had some heart. Characters had just the right amount of development to action. I don’t like mark ruffalo, a bit too much satire there, but the rest is fun, it’s worth the watch."
2025-04-17,10.0,"Imho this will become a cult classic alongside movies like Brazil and Life of brian.

It's somehow believable and way way way over the top. A lot of people probably dont realise it but Robert Pattinson is a brilliant actor and he's alongside other brilliant actors like Mark Ruffalo. And the rest of the cast are great. The director Bong Joon ho hopefully has a long future"
2025-04-16,8.0,"very good, not perfect"
2025-04-16,10.0,"Super impressed with this one! This movie made me feel many things, which many movies today don’t evoke. It was thrilling, comedic, futuristic, romantic, sent a message about the importance of life and was actually super sweet. Robert Patterson’s performance was amazing, I forgot many times throughout this film that he also played Edward. My love for him as an actor, and his craft definitely increased! It was also nice to see some new faces on screen. Safe to say I loved this movie! Would definitely watch again!"
2025-04-16,5.0,"Plot seemed recycled. Acting was slightly above par. CGI used for aliens were exceptional. However, overall nothing memorable."
2025-04-16,2.0,Despite some outstanding performances the film is under whelming . The premis was intriguing but rather than delivering a satisfying meal was more like a rice cake covered in chocolate .
2025-04-16,10.0,"Quirky, weird, and over the top. Like a melodrama stage play, everything went over-the-top. The acting to accomplish this unique film had to be top tier. Not only did the actors (and there were so many good ones!) step away from their usual stereotypical roles, but the sci-fi dark comedy went into a Wes Anderson-esque style of complicated misdirection and comedy. The whole plot was unexpected and surprising, with Robert Pattinson truly making this role his own. And I never could have predicted Mark Ruffalo being able to match so well with Toni Collette in portraying over-the-top craziness, but it worked. He made the character memorable and you hated him. By the end of the movie, you had heroes, and villains, and a new adorable alien to root for. I recommend watching it with friends, and enjoying the unexpected."
2025-04-16,10.0,"great movie, kinda funny the cgi was crazy to with the aliens"
2025-04-16,2.0,Top 5 worst movies I’ve ever seen. Mark Ruffalo is so terrible it makes me sick
2025-04-16,10.0,Great movie! I think it was better than the book. Excellent production.
2025-04-15,9.0,Loved the movie!! Now this is how you write a sci-fi movie. Everyone take notes.
2025-04-15,10.0,"I LOVE IT, I love EVERYTHING about it, when I say everything mean all."
2025-04-15,10.0,"I absolutely loved this movie. I hadn't watched any trailers so went in blind and I enjoyed it so much! I found Robert just hilarious. My favorite role of his, hands down. I got emotional sometimes for him! He nailed that role IMO. Thoroughly enjoyed it!"
2025-04-15,6.0,"A quirky sci-fi comedy so overstuffed with social and political commentary that it forgets about entertaining it's audience.  Shortly after wishing it was a different film altogether, I lost interest and thought about how much better Duncan Jones' ""Moon"" was."
2025-04-15,7.0,Well that was different!
2025-04-15,6.0,"I think if this had been made as a straight pg-13 movie, it would have been a lot more watchable and enjoyably. But too much strong profanity and adult themes, (ménage à trois?) for its target audience which i presume is high high and young adult."
2025-04-14,9.0,"A fun, intelligent, and extraordinary film, released at the perfect time. It portrays a society identical to ours—or at least the one we are becoming. Bong Joon-ho shifts science fiction from dystopian to utopian, crafting a story filled with deep themes: the importance of the individual in society and free will, the destruction of the environment by humankind, and political power in the hands of those who don’t deserve it. Incredible direction, brilliant performance by Pattinson, and a fantastic Mark Ruffalo. A must-watch film, even more impactful in IMAX format."
2025-04-14,2.0,Worst movie I’ve seen in a long long long time. I have no idea how it’s rated so high. Lots of potential with the plot but it’s brutaaalll
2025-04-14,2.0,"You lost me at - can't leave your political views & your hatred - out of a film. Very immature & unprofessional. I'm of course referring to the conservative types wearing red hats near the start of this garbage  movie who were portrayed as utter morons. Regardless though I did try to soldier on with this childish effort, like 3 or 4 times until finally, about half way through I simply ran out of legs.  Even if Bong could have stayed off the bong for 5 mins, I don't think I would have enjoyed it like I'd hoped anyway. It's kind of stupid. I'm giving it 3/10 but I'm deducting 1 point for wasting my time :0"
2025-04-14,10.0,Underrated. Love  how they didn't have an orgy with the clone.
2025-04-14,1.0,"While it is an interesting plot seed, like a bad tree and Mickey clones with no future, this one ends up taking us nowhere interesting or very entertaining. I actually walked out at the 45 minute mark & got a substitute ticket for something worth my time."
2025-04-14,6.0,"The first Bong Joon-Ho film that I'd consider a disappointment. Starts off dull with unlikable characters and a ditzy Robert Pattinson. Eventually, it turns into a moderately interesting fable with over-the-top performances from Ruffalo as a modern-day fascist. The film has its moments, and is a decent sci-fi comedy, but definitely not a worthy entry in the  mighty caliber of Joon-Ho's films."
2025-04-13,2.0,"Terrible film . Rubbish plot, rubbish acting, a very long two hours. Can see why WB lost millions on this epic failure."
2025-04-13,8.0,"Very funny movie, acting was pretty good, Mark Ruffalo plays a very ridiculous role."
2025-04-13,1.0,"As a huge fan of sci-fi and Bong Joon Ho, i am extremely disappointed. Bad script. Hammy acting. Overlong. Boring. No wonder it got delayed so many times and eventually bombed at the box office. Waste of time, talent and money."
2025-04-13,8.0,"Le film est très sympa, malheureusement, il ne pousse pas certains concepts assez loin et une fin qui semble assez baclée.
Malgré cela, le film est très agréable à regarder.

Un excellent film de Bong Joon Ho dans la ligné de Snowpiercer et Parasite."
2025-04-13,3.0,"Rob Pattinson versatility on display. You will be amazed at his accent, and his play of his character in different scenarios. He makes it fun, even if his character is so spineless it hurts. 

There’s also plenty of modern day themes at play: resource scarcity, oligarchy, genetics and science, space, castes and class systems, militarism, etc. 

Initially a quirky fun ride, but becomes lame when the alien life is revealed. A bit long for my liking. 

Would not rush to theaters or see again. D-"
2025-04-13,1.0,UNWATCHABLE because of Pattinson's idiotic voice choice.
2025-04-13,6.0,Starts of good the end is just crap
2025-04-13,1.0,"The movie is slow and boring. If you like Sci-Fi movies like Star Trek, Star Wars, Blade Runner, Terminator, don't waste your time with Mickey. Mark Rufallo at his worst."
2025-04-13,10.0,Incredible original story/adaptation. Robert Pattinson can do ANYTHING. Just stellar from Naomi Ackie too.
2025-04-13,8.0,"Original, sometimes funny, sometimes bizarre. Seeing Pattinson switch between the two versions of Mickey shows what a fantastic actor he is!"
2025-04-13,10.0,I just wanted to write “perfect”.
2025-04-13,1.0,"I Love Sci Fi movies; but I can't stomach the degrading of human dignity and disregarding the preciousness of human life. I'm 38 years old, and still.
""They'll just print another of you in the morning"" So there is no effort to save him. Just let him suffer and die multiple times. If you've got a heart for the sacredness of life, this is not your movie.
I don't know how this is ""comedy"". Nothing funny about it."
2025-04-13,3.0,"This movie has proven to me that this director really doesn’t have anything significant to say. Beyond the obscure and morbid moments that really just feel like they are there for a wow factor, they don’t really try to expand upon the phycological concepts of death and its mental toll. Instead, it becomes this bland love triangle story with the same cartoony overdramatic logic of Parasite that presents itself as artful directing, but just turns out feeling like a mess in the end."
2025-04-12,1.0,"I honestly disliked the entire movie.. my husband and I went on a movie date and he regrettably chose this movie. We were eating and I lost my appetite due to the disgusting scene when Mickey went to the dinner and was eating what looked like a glob of blood  
I also felt terrible watching this movie as a Christian. 
There were some scenes of blasphemy. It definitely felt like they were mocking God. 
Please dont make the same mistake I did. Save your money!!"
2025-04-12,8.0,Such an interesting plot line & super entertaining! I will be watching this again & again!
2025-04-12,10.0,Gonna rip my bong joon ho before I watch this
2025-04-12,10.0,I was not a huge fan of Patterson until now.  He was amazing and this movie spot on fun.  Loved the satire too.
2025-04-12,10.0,"There's something Verhoevenesque about Bong Joon Ho's version of expansionist human colonizers engaging in a bug hunt against innocent sapient insects, but where Starship Troopers leans so hard into its fashy Heinlein + Hugo Boss aesthetic that it's still argued whether it's homage or satire, Mickey 17 takes what should have been a very dark concept, that of a heavily hinted eugenicist theofascist (featuring Mark Ruffalo in yet another delightful heel turn after Poor Things) utilizing literal disposable slave labour to build his Space Reich on mass indigenous graves, and somehow it turns out to be… wholesome? Naomi Ackie's charismatic but slightly unhinged heroine is in large part why it works, especially paired with Anamaria Vartolomei as a romantic foil for the hapless Mickey's affections."
2025-04-12,9.0,"Creative, unique, heart-wrenching. Best Robert Pattinson  performance I’ve seen."
2025-04-12,9.0,"I loved the movie it had a fun, adventurous, and dangerous atmosphere. Robert Pattinson was a great Mickey I feel like this role was made for him. The switching between 17 and 18 was impressive. Mark Ruffalo was great, this role seemed too easy for him to do lol. And Steven yeun was great too I just wish I saw more of him a little bit. It was like Danny Cho from beef went to space. Great watch."
2025-04-12,2.0,"The positive reviews are clearly fake. It is quite literally one of the most confused, idiotic, and worst movies I’ve ever seen. The translation is really bad. The jokes don’t land. It doesn’t make sense. It’s so wild studio execs funded this."
2025-04-12,4.0,Ooof. Great book that deserved more. No wonder its release was delayed so many times. It is like a bad student film… insane over acting and cheap attempts at comedy. Belabored scenes. Lack of character arcs. Fundamental holes.
2025-04-12,1.0,"I wish i could get back my 2 hours and 14 mins back,"
2025-04-11,10.0,thought it was great loved the premise of the movie and the story telling
2025-04-11,1.0,Cool premise but everything else about it sucks
2025-04-11,2.0,I’ve seen a couple of films in my life that were absolutely dire…..sadly this is one of them (the other one was The Unbearable Lightness of Being). Literally 2 hours-ish of my life that I will never get back. God knows how much was spent on it…..but I think the money would have been better spent on a huge donation to a hospital…..Dull & really didn’t make much sense. Some actors should be ashamed of themselves signing up for drivel like this.
2025-04-11,1.0,mediocre. pointless. beyond stupid.
2025-04-11,1.0,This is the movie that proves just how goofy/ugly looking Robert Pattinson is
2025-04-11,1.0,This should have been an episode of Stargate. They would have made a better job of it.  Awful.
2025-04-11,9.0,I hope I'm not the only one to notice the New Testament similarities
2025-04-11,6.0,If you like Pattinson go. Not really my thing. It was alright.
2025-04-11,8.0,"Robert did an amazing job as Mickey 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18"
2025-04-11,5.0,"Don't understand a bit what it says and the entire project heads nowhere. 
Bong Joon Ho has distance from his glory of Parasite for what ?"
2025-04-10,10.0,"Best film I’ve seen in a long time, diving into politics, science fiction and aided by a stunning performance from Robert Pattinson."
2025-04-10,3.0,"Annoying and pointless satirical sci-fi that reminds one of better films and just leaves the viewer in exhaustion. The tone was all over the place and just ended up in muck. The characters were hardly developed and the make-up of the world wasn’t well defined, despite much time spent on exposition and backstory. Astonishing how much of a failure this was with so many creative elements and talent in front of and behind the camera. The cinematography, visuals, and production design were excellent, but what was it all for? Stay far away."
2025-04-10,8.0,"from a Sci-Fi point of view I enjoyed this movie from its satire dark comedy and just Robert Patterson my God, this is a great movie this is a fun time.

I could tell you everything and basically three sentences and that won't spoil how fun and interesting this movie is.

and to those who don't like it because of what it's parodying, hey, if the hat fits wear it."
2025-04-10,10.0,Best movie I’ve seen in a long time!!
2025-04-10,6.0,"It's neither here or there on the direction it wants to go. Is it an existential movie? Political? Ethical? Romance? They dont follow any purposefully, but still a decent watch."
2025-04-10,8.0,This was pretty remarkable The performance was great the things that micky went through were insane the visuals wow some of the  monsters super cool it was crazy how the mayor was  acting there's some great moments in here I was very happy not disappointed at all The concept is really unbelievable.
2025-04-10,1.0,"I must be missing something here.  Very slow pace, illogical, I had to FF big time to finish it."
2025-04-10,7.0,"A gloriously messy sci-fi fever dream. Bong Joon Ho swings big with clones, capitalism, and chaotic Pattinson x2. Not as tight as Parasite, but bold, weird, and unforgettable."
2025-04-10,1.0,This movie has more real world political motivations behind it than anything else. Force feeding a narrative rarely leads to a good movie and this proves true here.
2025-04-10,4.0,"Mickey 17 was new and interesting, yet quite forgettable...no, scratch that, it was NOT forgettable, because it is now burned into my brain and I can't unsee how painful it was to actually view. The only reason I rate it two stars is because I watched it with my boyfriend and we both agreed it was awful. In all seriousness, the film went between picking up in a few places to absolutely dragging and feeling like it would never end. There were sex scenes that I felt were unnecessary and did nothing for the plot, and the villain was lame and annoying. (Especially his wife.) There were a few funny moments, but other than that, the only good part of this entire movie were the creepers and the part where Mickey screams when he sees his double. The only thing I appreciated is the fact that they gave Mickey 18 a different (almost alter-ego) personality from Mickey 17, because even though they were they were the same individual in body, they were different people entirely in mind which made them unique and represented that each expendable was indeed their own person in a way."
2025-04-10,7.0,It was something new to watch.
2025-04-10,10.0,"Great film! Funny, good writing, and character development. A real sci-fi movie. Fine work. 10 years ago it would have made 300 million in box office"
2025-04-10,10.0,"This film blends existential dread with clever, biting dark humor and it does so brilliantly! The movie stands out for its creativity and effortlessly balancing moments of absurdity with genuine stakes. Another great movie from Bong Joon-ho! 👏

Robert Pattinson delivers a standout performance! His portrayal of Mickey is layered, tragic, and often laugh-out-loud funny, anchoring the film in a humanity that elevates the concept."
2025-04-10,4.0,"It's not great, you can tell the entire story and ending within the first 10 minutes of the movie. Everything, the human cloning part and where that goes, the alien species, its the most generic writing movie cliches ever. I love cheese movies usually but this is not done well. The directing is fine, but the characters and actors draw in no emotional connection and make zero sense for their role in the movie. I'm not sure even the writers knew what they wanted this movie to be to the point I'm not sure what I even watched, or the takeaway from it."
2025-04-10,1.0,"the first hour felt like 4 hours and it was the good part. The whole expendable thing seems unnecessary in the end and not the main core of the movie. Is just a mess of sub plots thrown in just because. it could have developed in better ways but Ho decided for the worst one possible. ""Avatar all over again"" vibes."
2025-04-10,10.0,The plot is very odd but that's what makes it great. Never seems to take itself to seriously but also doesn't fall into the weird meta state that some sci fi movies do. Character development is excellent and the great acting pulls it all together. This could have gone south in a hurry but instead they created a gem of a movie.
2025-04-10,2.0,"Way too long and Mickey 17 was just weak.  Spoiler if you don't quite know the story.  A man signs up to go to another planet and allows himself to be killed over and over again to be brought back with his memories intact.  So we end up with Mickey 17.  16 before all dead.  The idea is much better then the execution.  The acting for the two main villains is over the top and not in a fun way given this was advertised as sort of a comedy.

Trust me its not nor is it interesting.    This is an half hour too long a tad boring and stupid."
2025-04-10,5.0,I was rooting for the movie the whole time but it never quite comes together (it dabbles in critiques of capitalism and colonialism but it never says anything new or interesting or even all that correct) even if there are minor elements I liked (Toni Collette's obsessions with sauces and those wooly space worms are cool).
2025-04-10,10.0,THE BABY PUPPY ALIENSSSSS AND THE FACT THAT INVINCIBLEs VOICE ACTOR WAS ONE OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS
2025-04-09,1.0,"I wanted to like this due to all the good actors in it. However, this snooze fest was just not entertaining. Pretentious piffle at its finest."
2025-04-09,8.0,"It's a politically engaged film that doesn't entirely stray away from the plot itself, it only serves to further enhance the storytelling of this film. 

Robert Pattinson's range in his performance proves his capability to act and deliver a character that convinces you of all the Mickeys' individuality and existence.

8/10 movie"
2025-04-09,9.0,"My husband and I enjoyed seeing this in theaters. We loved Parasite and Snowpiercer. Robert Pattinson is so talented and his portrayal of Mickey should win some awards. The supporting case is equally good, love me some Steven Yuen and Toni Collette, and I am a new fan of Naomi Ackie. Really interesting concept and reminds me of other movies and shows dealing with cloning and copies of someone. This movie might not be for everyone but if you enjoy Bong Joon Ho and sci-fi, it is a must see."
2025-04-09,9.0,"Mikey 17 had a unique twist on the rebellion genre. The cloning plot line played nicely along with the over arching story line. It was nice to see 17 and 18 have two different view points, It almost like every person who sees the movie will relate differently depending which Mikey they personally relate to more. A movie that makes you ponder the dialogue that is spoken is always great in my mind."
2025-04-09,8.0,"Strange, different and a little bit cheesy but it's definitely worth a watch."
2025-04-09,1.0,Trash movie. Boring. Not funny or interesting. Made it through an hour and twenty minutes and was disappointed to learn that there was still forty minutes left.
2025-04-09,4.0,How on earth does Mark Raffalo keep getting acting gigs? some people should just retire
2025-04-09,2.0,"I found this to be a very predictable, boring movie, full of too many stereotypes to be the edgy take on science fiction that it attempts to be. I wouldn’t waste my time."
2025-04-09,10.0,"Really good movie, great storyline .. second 10/10 in 2025 for me so far"
2025-04-09,2.0,Heavy handed on the political commentary
2025-04-08,8.0,"Good film, entertaining, satirical and funny. However, the more you watch, the more you get sad because although it is with joy that we see a large number of leads and possibilities for the plot to strengthen itself and address certain themes (populism, love triangle, human exploitation) with more force, nothing happens. It's a great shame. It's a satirical film that hasn't left the lukewarm water of the captivating 'Mickey' concept, easy to convey, and guaranteeing a wide audience, as well as the choice of the main actor. You have to see this film, if only for the series of poor Mickeys, employed worse than disposable because infinitely reusable, who behave like a sheep and who are adorable. We laugh, and we are horrified: very Irish. And the aliens, frankly, they are so fair and loyal that we almost want to be killed by them. Like: I love you too much, take my life!"
2025-04-08,8.0,'Mickey 17' is an unique satirical sci-fi triumph that is throughout hilarious and filled with enough depth.
2025-04-08,2.0,"So Stupid.. waist of time, Cars at drive-in were leaving through this movie"
2025-04-08,7.0,"Mickey 17 has a very interesting and positive narrative, I think the director had a good proposal for the film however... I think that in some situations the central story gets a little confusing."
2025-04-08,10.0,The acting and writing were great. It was nice to have seen a movie that created such intelligent material to talk about after movie with my friends. Will have to see again now to watch for other perspectives that were brought up to me.
2025-04-08,8.0,Great movie. Rob killed as Mickey obviously.
2025-04-08,6.0,"Interesting premise and nice setup at the beginning  plus the setting and characters make you want to see what develops (the weird humor definitely helps!). But midway through the movie it seems to run out of steam and becomes just plain silly and ho-hum. Maybe it's because it's just too long  (2 hours 15 minutes) but at the end (no pun intended) it just wasn't satisfying, IMHO. Diehard sci-fi fans may disagree..."
2025-04-08,2.0,A chewy piece of crap. Hard to believe this is the same mind behind Parasite or Snowpiecer.
2025-04-08,10.0,"I found this movie wonderfully refreshing. Pattison is really good in it. His voices are so unique and distinct. This movie is so dark, funny yet totally makes me think, “Yeah people would do that.” Art direction is also amazing."
2025-04-08,6.0,"Well the previews kind of gave away some spoilers, but I expected a little more from this movie. Patterson IMO is a very underrated actor. It felt like he was limited from performing at his maximum potential."
2025-04-08,8.0,Sci fi dark comedy with plenty of humor.  I loved the aliens!
2025-04-08,8.0,"It's honestly slightly longer than it should, but! at the same time you kinda want it to have a sequel... It's a really interesting take on exploring space, the story is somewhat funny and the more it progress the more you develop a soft spot for Mickey and let not forget the crippers which are soooo cute... It's a great film to watch between Monday and Thursday not yet worthy of Friday but it has potential to be a good weekend comedic relief if you find it funny."
2025-04-07,10.0,Phenomenal Movie. No complaints here.
2025-04-07,1.0,"I have no idea how this is getting positive reviews. It's absolutely terrible. Bad acting, exaggerated caricatures of characters and a ridiculously stupid story."
2025-04-07,3.0,"Not worth a minute.
The play seems like it was written by a child.
Would've been a good episode in a sitcom but not a 2 hour long movie."
2025-04-07,1.0,"Half a star, and that's only for Tim Key dressed as a pigeon.  Otherwise, awful."
2025-04-07,7.0,"An impressive performance by Robert Pattison as he gets the opportunity to show various personalities and character traits in this film. Credit to Toni Collette and Mark Ruffalo who give great performances as the “villains” and I love that Mark Ruffalo’s Dictator follows Toni’s every word. 

A well-written story and a great watch (one you will need to concentrate for though!) but I’m left thinking the ending was rushed.

The Creepers were noteworthy and kudos to their designers."
2025-04-07,3.0,Honestly really dragged out. It's not funny or serious just somewhere in between.
2025-04-07,4.0,"Es un trabajo que busca interpretar distintas temáticas, pero con una narrativa que parece sacada de una idea muy básica..."
2025-04-07,7.0,"Enjoyed it. As always, a commentary on the current human condition space development, biological research, morality, relationships, leadership egos and war."
2025-04-07,9.0,"Great movie, very relevant to our current situation."
2025-04-06,4.0,"An ambitious and technically well-made film, but too long and not funny at all."
2025-04-06,8.0,Confusing beginning but explosive finale.
2025-04-06,10.0,I personally loved it. I am a sci fi and independent movie fan and this pulled both worlds together.
2025-04-06,9.0,"Great sci-fi fun. Plays like a Wes Anderson shags Fifth Element movie....cool as hell. Impressed with cast most notably J Pattison, Ruffalo and College."
2025-04-06,7.0,Es una película entretenida
2025-04-06,7.0,"A thought provoking, funny and absurdist look at the near future with interesting themes of death and rebirth or ""reprinting"". Feels like groundhogs day meets Aliens, but a bit less exciting. 
The story misses many opportunities and fails to fully flesh out the more poignant and exciting aspects of its main protagonist predicament of being able to artificially regenerate aboard an intergalactic colonizing mission. Maybe it should of been a series. 
Still fun and entertaining with amazing performances all around and a scrumptiously devious and annoying performance by Mark Ruffalo.  
Cool movie!"
2025-04-06,6.0,"Lost the plot a bit there, and makes you really confused about characters and their motivations. Had really cool ideas and you can tell the actors are talented but it gets a bit lost under the empty wandering that is the plot."
2025-04-06,7.0,"Mickey 17 was a fun scifi movie. The story is pretty good but you can feel a certain limitation in the budget at times. That said it does rely on certain CGI effects, but you basically stay on the ship or one planet, The acting is superb, but the senator role is wildly exaggerated. I also didn't like the odd voice choice (a nasal child like) they did for Mickey, but it 's bearable. The sounds are pretty good. I give it a 75%. Good movie worth at least one watch, but if you dislike Ruffalo or Pattisson, it might not be for you. They pretty much carry the movie."
2025-04-06,9.0,Really fun sci fi adventure with a good political message. I appreciate the almost Star Wars aesthetic but with adult themes. It’s one that must be seen in theaters to fully appreciate. Plus I love Bing Joon Ho. He always mixes righteous politics with a wacky sense of humor.
2025-04-06,4.0,"The storyline was interesting but not well executed. Tried to be funny at times, but it just didn't work. The ending was a letdown and didn't quite make sense."
2025-04-06,3.0,"Really wanted to like this but thought it was terrible. The performances are so hammy and scream non comedic actors trying to be funny. There were a few enjoyable moments but this was down to the editing team which I will praise. The narration of Robert Pattison forcing a nerdy American accent gives it an inauthenticity that runs through the film. I've seen it being compared to Terry Gillian but its lacks the surrealism, artistry and emotional heart of his work. Finally the message of colonialism and corrupt politicians is so basic it make you start to think starship troopers is highbrow. I have no idea how this was a $200m film is you want to see the concept done right watch Moon"
2025-04-06,1.0,"This is hands down the worst movie I've ever seen. The plot goes absolutely nowhere, the characters are weak with steely little to no development, with an ending that could have come far sooner. Are movies just getting worse or what?"
2025-04-06,10.0,I loved it it was such a funny yet dramatic film I felt bad for Mickey along the way I could feel his pain 5 stars no doubt I 100% say to watch this 10/10 loved it
2025-04-06,3.0,The first half of the movie was good but then it turned very silly. I wish I would have left before it was over.
2025-04-06,10.0,"It was an abosulute delight! Robert Pattinson portrayed 17 just right: a naive boy that should not have has much of an interesting character as it turned out to be. Even the portrayal of 18 was wonderful as just by mannerisms was easy to tell which one was which.
The caricatures played by Marshal and his wife were ridiculous and yet closely resembling the current political leaders. Great job by those actors too.
Do not come in expecting Parasite 2.0, It's a genuine Hollywood film, but it is a great one. The two hours went by quickly, definitely a must watch.
Happy ending was the good surprise I wasn't expecting. Really good."
2025-04-06,1.0,"Disappointing, very disappointed."
2025-04-06,6.0,interesting plot but went all over the place with too many different threads and paths.
2025-04-06,6.0,"Um filme bem simples, não vão com muita expectativa para o filme..."
2025-04-06,2.0,Slow and terrible after 30 mins.
2025-04-06,7.0,"Sorry but Mickey’s accent, killed it for me. Otherwise the Hulk did an amazing job contorting his face and voice."
2025-04-06,2.0,"I appreciate how the director was trying to do something different. Ruffalo sidelines the movie by doing a cringe bit of a president during the whole movie. I get he is struggling, but why should one man's political opinion jeopardize all the other people who are working on this film? The movie then finds time to mock Christian faith, prayer, and worship. It loses itself in its own mockery. I had to turn the movie off half way through because it was so bad. I'm so grateful I did not actually spend a penny on seeing this movie, save yourself the time."
2025-04-06,5.0,"Not sure what to make of this movie. It's sci-fi like Starship Troopers but no action. But also like Hunger Games and Save the whales? Everyone knows the Korean director but there's only one Korean actor in the movie? It's not an action movie even though it's sci-fi but the CGI alien species is pretty good. Overall pretty boring, definitely wouldn't watch again. Maybe Korean directors should stick to Korean revenge dramas since they make some of the best. Sci-fi movies should be done by American directors since sci-fi is our bread and butter."
2025-04-06,3.0,The Whole concept dad potential but the story was poor and nonexistent. The comedy was completely unnecessary and not good had times along with mark ruffalo's performance just was not funny. If the film could of been 90min easy and told a serious story but it is nothing more than a comedy with no plot.
2025-04-05,3.0,"Too long and not as funny as some claim. The world ""subtlety"" is used to suggest there is humour but hidden.  I couldn't find it which means it isn't funny for some people or not there at all.  Its plot is convoluted and unnecessarily.  It's as if the writers  wanted to give the idea that all those things that happen on screen actually have a purpose. And they don't, unless the director's intention is to trick the audience into some kind of consensual zombie state that this is a very clever film.  For those who love the journey rather than the destination, and by that i mean who love the view of distorted passing scenery from a bus window, this might be for them."
2025-04-05,7.0,"Slightly disappointing. After watching the trailer for this movie and reading the plot, I was really excited for this movie, but after watching it, I felt a bit disappointed as I expected a much different and exciting storyline.

The movie itself was not bad, it was pretty good. Robert Pattinson was incredible, the way he made Mickey 17 and Mickey 18 feel like completely different characters is just a testament to his incredible range and acting ability. Mark Ruffalo also did an amazing job as playing a snubby politician who only cares about himself and no one else, his character was extremely unlikable throughout the movie which was a good thing.

I expected this movie to be about a guy, going on many adventures and dying and being reprinted each time, and for there to be this big bad. What we got instead was a ""civil war"" between Mickey 18 and Kenneth Marshall, and a few alien creatures who wanted peace.

The acting and many scenes were done really well which made the movie enjoyable, just a little let down by the storyline. Overall this is a good movie but nothing too crazy."
2025-04-05,1.0,"Hard to follow, boring, all over the place. Felt like it was trying to be The Hunger Games, mixed with starship troopers. Worst movie I've seen in ages."
2025-04-05,5.0,Started out entertaining and interesting but then just died off.
2025-04-05,7.0,"Mickey 17 is a fun twist on the clone concept. The film is funny, well-directed, and well-performed. It loses a little steam in the second half, but it's definitely a good time."
2025-04-05,1.0,"ruffalo again brings sewer smell to any movie he iz in . 
the story and the lame cgi of alien cowz - far from great , toni collette and naomi are a joy to watch while pattinson just makes sure in every frame to show how ugly is character is , but micky should be loveable even tho is a little ugly - that is the reason all the women in the movie want to boink him ."
2025-04-05,10.0,"Me gusto un montón está propuesta disruptiva con tintes aveces hasta absurdos, me divertí en el cine está vez! 10/10 para Robert, lo está haciendo increíble cada vez ✨"
2025-04-05,6.0,"I absolutely loved the first two-thirds of the movie. Pattinson's eccentric performance is hysterically dark and subtle, while still coming across as an incredibly likeable everyman.

The final third of the movie leans hard into Ruffalo's uninspired impression of a certain politician and the plot devolves into boring adventure movie cliches that feel like they're from an entirely different film than the first 2/3.

However, I enjoyed the first 2/3 of the film so much that I have to recommend it. It's a lesser Bong Joon Ho film, but it still has enough of the touch of an auteur to be worth your while."
2025-04-05,10.0,Robert is fantastic.
2025-04-05,7.0,"While it may serve as proof that directors tend to lose their touch after they winning at the Oscar’s, it pulls a few punches that are worth watching at least once."
2025-04-04,10.0,"Highly creative, beautiful production design, amazing performances with a creative story.  What more could you want?"
2025-04-04,7.0,"Mickey 17 is a bold, bizarre sci-fi ride from Bong Joon Ho that juggles cloning, colonization, and... an obsession with sauce? Robert Pattinson delivers a fantastic dual performance as two versions of the same man, and the visuals are top-tier.

But despite the intriguing premise and strong acting, the film buckles under its own ambition—stuffed with half-baked subplots, cartoonish side characters, and tonal whiplash. One minute it’s existential dread, the next it’s pigeon suits and slapstick comedy.

It’s a movie that dares to be different, but ends up feeling like five movies crammed into one.

Verdict: Fascinating, flawed, and worth a watch—just don’t expect another Parasite."
2025-04-04,10.0,AMAZING QUIRKY GREAT STORYLINE HUMOROUS
2025-04-04,8.0,For all its cheesiness I really enjoyed this movie.
2025-04-04,2.0,Absolute trashhh movie. No plot and the story doesn’t lead anywhere
2025-04-04,5.0,sooooo many plot points that went nowhere. felt too drawn out overall.
2025-04-04,6.0,"Movie was funny at times and was GREAT , but the length of the movie and the main event being pushed and I felt like rushed at the end was unnecessary for it be that long for no reason."
2025-04-04,3.0,"The film featured many significant characters, but they didn’t feel impactful or well-developed."
2025-04-04,2.0,Malísima. Malas actuaciones especialmente la de Marck Ruffalo
2025-04-04,2.0,"So so bad. Written by someone who hates normal. I wasn't a huge Mark Ruffalo fan to begin with, though I did like him as the Hulk, but I may never go see another one of his movies again. his character is so grotesquely unlikable. The concensus amongst my friends who saw the movie last night, is that the movie was written to mock every aspect of the current political administration. It was so over the top. Don't waste your hard earned cash on this one. We wish we hadn't."
2025-04-04,5.0,"The execution of the film was outstanding, great CGI, world-building accompanied with superb acting. This was let down by a boring story with no attachments to any of the characters leaving it feeling like a waste of time. Overall - It’s alright."
2025-04-04,1.0,This was the first movie i walked out of
2025-04-04,4.0,"If you like your political commentary and satire as subtle as dental work done with power tools then maybe this is for you.

Everyone knows villains will study pathology on an innocent without empathy, but they also know how public sentiment can kick them in the granticles so they tend to hide their evil villainy.

I get the over-the-top satirical comedic attempt but do we really need two copies of a protagonist that push both edges of edgelord at the same time?  This movie threw a whole cast of social antiheroes at us by grinding our noses in humanity's carpet bombs at every opportunity?

Gah... give me a break."
2025-04-04,10.0,"WOW, just wow. Not an easy movie. ItItss a lot. But that's what we want from movies sometimes."
2025-04-04,10.0,Beautiful satire and commentary. And Mark Ruffalo as the Trmp figure - exquisite
2025-04-04,2.0,"Painfully stupid. If you take the low IQ character writing of something like the Hunger Games. Which is understandably written for teenagers. Then divide that IQ in half. You get the characters in this movie. NOT ONE SINGLE person acts like an adult. Instead pretty much every character, and worse of all, all the main characters. Act like the insane version of adults that a 14 might find believable."
2025-04-03,6.0,"Beautifully shot, Pattinson is fantastic, doesn’t quite all come together and tone is all over the place. Appreciate the big swings, just missed by a bit."
2025-04-03,10.0,"If you like Robert Pattinson, it’s a must see. He is really coming to his own in this physicality and mentally demanding role. Sci- fi satirical statement of society, you can watch Mickey make himself available “to discard” because he is poor, desperate, but has a special ability. The uber rich, ignorant couple take advantage of “subjects” in the name of science to try to inhabit a planet that already has its occupants. I am a sucker for the underdog!"
2025-04-03,7.0,"Good film, great root story line, well produced! Fun movie but too much political satire for me."
2025-04-03,6.0,It was Ok like the actors were really good and the there was some good moments but there was a lot of plot holes that did not get explored
2025-04-03,3.0,"I liked the social critique about colonization, the exploitation of people for purposes of ''science'' but I think the gratuitous mocking of the ''church'' or ''company'' as they call it in the movie is taking it a bit too far. Portraying all the bad guys as devoted members of the ''church'' and mocking prayer and religious singing... I didn't find that funny. And if you think this is an action movie, it's not exactly. As in for the rest, it is somewhat funny"
2025-04-03,6.0,Major waste of time.  Gets more and more ridiculous.  But Pattisons is very sweet and endearing.
2025-04-03,6.0,"While overlong and narratively unfocused, Bong Joon Ho's Mickey 17 is still able to replicate continued laughs amid all the scientific, sociological satire."
2025-04-02,10.0,"This movie is very well understood by introverted people because it shows how much polite, introverted, and shy individuals have been wronged and had their rights taken away in society.❤️‍🩹
From a cinematography perspective, the film had excellent framing, and with Robert Pattinson’s outstanding acting, this movie deserves higher ratings, like an 8.5 out of 10 or even more.
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
2025-04-02,10.0,Just go watch it and don’t even judge the movie enjoy it !!!
2025-04-02,9.0,"I am a movie lover and until now wasn't really a fan of Robert Pattinson but he did an amazing job in this movie and playing the dual role was spectacular. It was funny, and yes the cheesy roles played by the married couple running the show, played by Toni Colette and Mark Ruffalo, who you love to hate was nice to see them in less serious roles.

The little aliens are just so darn cute! While it's not an ""alien"" movie, they do factor in and add to the humour in this movie.  I can't wait to watch it again."
2025-04-02,7.0,"Pretty good original story, glad I saw it. May not be one I need to see again, but not bad."
2025-04-02,5.0,"Fun & sharply edited, but overly long doesn't know what it wants to be. Great premise, great start but meandering plot switches gear halfway thru from poignant social/labor commentary to benevolent aliens-vs-ignorant humans...a boring, played-out trope. Senseless subplots weigh down the narrative and pull from focus from where it should be, on Mickey."
2025-04-02,1.0,As bad as Dune 2 but more turgid.
2025-04-02,10.0,Did not fall asleep!
2025-04-02,8.0,"I went to see it in the cinema after I managed to get family to go to it. I knew about it enough to convince them. I also try to see or read as little as possible about any movie. Making the correct trailer is a lost art. Most trailers give out too much information about the movie.

I try to make my movie reviews as spoiler free as I can. I have to say movie hit a little too close to home, considering our current political environment. The movie is a good satire about where we could be in a few decades. It is a lot more like Arrival when I think about how aliens are portrayed. There is an actual story that makes sense. Actors are good, I cannot say if any of them were better than the others. All of them were very well picked. To my surprise, I discovered recently there is an actress of Romanian origin in it. Movie looks very well, it has very nice Star Wars like scenes and takes advantage of its imagery. It is well worth to be seen on a large screen. When it will hit streaming, I will watch it again, I am sure I missed a lot of Easter eggs.

I actually consider this movie a direct descendant of another lost gem, Idiocracy. This is the Idiocracy of our times."
2025-04-02,7.0,"Mickey 17 is an entertaining film that, while promising more, doesn’t fully live up to its potential. The premise is interesting, but the plot turns out to be simpler than expected—at times even feeling somewhat silly. It seems like the film could have offered a more complex and thought-provoking narrative, but it stays on the surface.

Robert Pattinson delivers an excellent performance, once again proving his versatility and commitment to unique roles. Mark Ruffalo also does a great job, as expected, though his character isn’t as impactful or layered as one might have hoped.

Visually, the film stands out with well-executed special effects and immersive world-building. In that regard, it’s a spectacle worth watching on the big screen.

In conclusion, Mickey 17 is an entertaining movie with strong performances and solid production values, but it ultimately feels like it could have been a more ambitious and profound experience."
2025-04-02,10.0,"This film held the same aesthetic as Snowpiercer another 5/5 experience. All elements of this world and version of reality were so well explored and crafted that only left me wanting more time with it. 

The humour hit every time from all characters and their quirks. I don't believe there was a thing that could make the film better, other than being longer."
2025-04-02,2.0,"Wow. What a stinker! 
Garbage – and yes, I get it.
A feeble tale that might have scored some satirical points but only collapses into to a ham-handed attempt at camp after the knife dulls. An odiferous stew of bad scenes better left on the cutting room floor. Viewers are subjected to repetitious, redundant gags that weren't clever the first time and didn't improve with the recycling. If the aim was to deliver a deliberately awful film, mission accomplished.  
A shame considering how good was Parasite. 
Bong Joon Ho is an emperor without a stitch of clothing who disgraces himself with this mess."
2025-04-02,8.0,There are so many reasons I loved this movie: Pattinson successfully plays against his leading man type; Ruffalo and Collette's bombastic performances are completely hilarious and over the top; the story speaks to our moment in political history; and the director made me care about the little Creeper critters. The film moves like lightening but still has a heart.
2025-04-02,10.0,"Great acting, fun movie, interesting concept — unique directing and style that may not be for everyone. Awesome, to me."
2025-04-02,10.0,"Micky 17 is a unique and entertaining film. In true Bong Joon Ho style, Micky 17 entices the viewer to consider deep philosophical and ethical questions about life and humanity, whilst critiquing power, through laughter and absurdity. Another win for the directer, well cast, great dialogue, fun and entertaining."
2025-04-02,10.0,"DARK, SAD, HILARIOUS! A great and honest representation of how humanity handles the future. A grand adventure in total"
2025-04-02,8.0,"I enjoyed the movie. There were stellar performances all around. Robert Pattinson was the reason I came to see it, and he did not disappoint.
Mark Ruffalo and Toni Collette were a surprise for me, but they also did a decent job of being the absolute worst.
The movie all around was worth the watch. The story was decent, but the themes of the film were screaming where a more reserved voice could have done the same.
I would recommend and would even venture to watch again, despite some of the film's weaknesses."
2025-04-02,9.0,Me gustó más de lo que esperaba
2025-04-02,6.0,A great idea and a great book and original story. But absolutely ruined by Ruffalo’s ridiculous characterization of Kenneth Marshall.
2025-04-02,10.0,"A refreshing sci-fi take on the perils and horrors of life when marred with incompetent leadership, the devaluation of human rights, and disregard for the consequences of ""letting the ends justify the means""."
2025-04-02,2.0,This movie lacked a plot and the acting was horrible. I feel like I wasted my time and money. Good effects.
2025-04-02,1.0,"This is why people stopped going to the movies: moronic, insufferable, incoherent, meandering, weak, and pretentious."
2025-04-02,4.0,"Walked out with 30 minutes to spare. 

This movie plot was all over the place and lost sight of the amazing philosophical ideas this movie was supposed to tackle. 

“Comedy” scenes were mildly chuckle worthy, most “meh.”

Trump impersonation was a cheesy hack job and just poorly done, just boring with no real purpose behind it other than a boring overdone “Trump sucks” statement. 

Sexy, sultry scenes took up way too much screen time for very little value. 

Amazing visuals, and Robert Pattison acting KILLED IT, as in it was amazing. :)"
2025-04-02,2.0,Two hours of my life I'll never get back. Worst movie I have ever seen in a theater.
2025-04-01,5.0,Great premise.  So-so story.  Really weak dialogue.
2025-04-01,3.0,"Poor plot and a very slow start that doesn’t allow you to connect with the characters. Very surface level writing which is so unfortunate as this film had a really strong concept. If this film was 30-50 minutes shorter, maybe it would’ve maintained the audiences attention."
2025-04-01,3.0,Bong's first bad film.  Ya hate to see it.
2025-04-01,1.0,"The main plot is fragmented, the relationship between the characters is not high, and many places that can be elaborated are not explained. 

The appearance of the King Insect is just a villain; Expendable, the core of the movie, didn't give in-depth explanation. The whole movie is just worth watching through streaming movies and it is still crap = = ."
2025-04-01,2.0,"The movie is horrible, it's not a comedy, it has jokes for adults that a pure American adult will find funny, and it's uncomfortable if you go to the theater with children."
2025-04-01,4.0,"A bigger budget, more bloated, version of Moon (2009) which is just a better written film. Pattinson is a caricature in this. Ruffalo was borderline unwatchable. Bong Joon Ho is considered a genius, but this is certainly a mark on his career considering the script is woefully dumb. Also, its possible to just write and direct a good film without cramming heavy handed social commentary into everything you create. Or y'know... just be more subtle."
2025-04-01,8.0,"Bong Joon-ho strikes cinematic gold once again with his latest sci-fi satire, Mickey 17. As always, Bong’s deft touch is evident in his exploration of a dystopian world, where he delivers a chillingly relevant critique of a fascist government. The timing of this film’s release is especially poignant, resonating not only with the political climate of the United States but with the global instability that looms over us all. Mark Ruffalo’s performance is a standout, delivering a portrayal that is both chilling and captivating. It’s clear that he drew heavy inspiration from a certain real-life figure, infusing his character with an intensity that leaves little to the imagination about his motivations and the dark, twisted psyche that drives him. Robert Pattinson, meanwhile, delivers a stunning dual performance as the titular Mickey, skillfully breathing unique life into two distinct iterations of the same character. His nuanced portrayal showcases his ability to differentiate the two versions, making each one feel fresh and dynamic, a feat that adds layers to the film’s complex narrative. Like many of Bong Joon-ho’s films, Mickey 17 is a work that rewards multiple viewings. Its rich, thought-provoking story and underlying themes will unfold more with each watch, revealing new layers and deeper meanings. This is a film that stays with you, demanding both reflection and interpretation long after the credits roll."

2025-04-01,8.0,"Even though it's 2 hours long, it kept me entertained and made me laugh 😂  Robert Pattinson nailed it 🤩👊 A fun watch 🧐✌️"
2025-04-01,8.0,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. On the surface, it’s an excellent sci-fi, absurdist comedy/drama, with shades of Terry Gilliam, a drop of Wes Anderson, and a *smidgen* of Jean Pierre-Jeunet, and underneath is a beautiful (if confrontational) examination of capitalism, politics, religion, and the value of a single human life

This is a movie for people who like a puzzle, who ponder philosophy, who appreciate layered storytelling, and not for someone who just wants to sit down and turn their brain off. If you are one such who seeks to *connect* with a film, someone who searches for a tale with *meaning*, then I cannot recommend this one highly enough"
2025-04-01,2.0,Stupid humor. Dumb plot.
2025-04-01,5.0,"Mickey 17 isn’t really good or bad—it’s one of those movies that’s fun but not exactly memorable. The satire works well, poking fun at things we deal with in everyday life. It’s not a masterpiece, but it’s not a waste of time either. Worth watching as long as you don’t expect too much!"
2025-04-01,4.0,I wish I could forget that I saw this.
2025-04-01,3.0,"The premise had so much potential, but this movie fails to explore it in any depth. Instead it wastes time with childish writing and hand-holding dialogue to make it clear that the writers thought very little of the audience. From the dumb antagonist basically kicking a puppy to make sure you get that he’s the bad guy - to the female protagonist explaining the plot in case you weren't following along, it ends up being less “Living With Yourself” and more like “Spy Kids”."
2025-04-01,3.0,"It has a cold, unredeeming darkness and hopelessness that lingered in theme and visually."
2025-04-01,2.0,"It tried to be too many things at once, and in the process is nothing of them particularly well.

The story, apart from the main premise, is pretty dull. (It felt a bit recycled overall)

The overall tone is a very unsettling mix of serious and comedic. It reminded me a bit of starship troopers (which I also didn't really like), but a bit more extreme on both ends. (Trying to take it self serious, while at the same time making zero attempt at hiding the ridiculousness - and weakly executed social commentary)"
2025-03-31,1.0,"My far the worst movie i had to pay to watch in my life.The actors protrayed
a dumb version of themselves, Bad"
2025-03-31,7.0,I was bored in the beginning and middle and the movie didn't captivate me. But the ending is well done.
2025-03-31,6.0,"It is an amazing ok movie. However, The antagonist is too much of a caricature."
2025-03-31,6.0,"Pattinson delivers his best performance yet, and the film is well-directed. However, what starts as a promising story ultimately falls into cliché."
2025-03-31,8.0,"The family had a lot of fun at this movie, it treads the line between absurdist social commentary and moving emotional impact while still being able to twirl around many different topics from exploitation, privilege, ethical technology and more.  The effects were good, a balance between minimalist and well chosen big budget style for effect."
2025-03-31,7.0,Enjoyed this one and liked the premise that is evidently based off of a book. I do think it could have been 20 minutes shorter and there is a clear lull in the middle that if trimmed would have made things better. I am not a huge sci-fi person so with the cloning already happening I think not making things on a new planet would have helped. But that is definitely just me. Overall a solid movie.
2025-03-31,2.0,Terrible movie!! Ruffalo was at his worst
2025-03-31,2.0,seems like it was written by someone that doesn't know how humans converse with each other and it almost seems like someone's fanfiction
2025-03-31,8.0,A little weird but a good watch
2025-03-31,6.0,Good acting. Interesting storyline. Probably could have trimmed a half hour off and tightened it up
2025-03-31,4.0,"I went in with really high expectations, Robert Pattison is working better and better, but this was not a great movie.

Forced humor, Mark Ruffalo is so bad is painful to see

Don't waste money on this, just stream it"
2025-03-31,1.0,"Boring, long, weak story line. Time you will never get back."
